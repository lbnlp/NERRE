Trap exploration in amorphous boron-doped ZnO films.	boron @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
This paper addresses the trap exploration in amorphous boron-doped ZnO (ZnO:B) films using an asymmetric structure of metal-oxide-metal.	boron @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@ B @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
In this work, the structure of Ni/ZnO:B/TaN is adopted and the ZnO:B film is deposited by RF magnetron sputtering.	B @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
The as-deposited ZnO:B film is amorphous and becomes polycrystalline when annealing temperature is above 500 ï¿½C.	B @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
According to the analysis of conduction mechanism in the as-deposited ZnO:B devices, Ohmic conduction is obtained at positive bias voltage because of the Ohmic contact at the TaN/ZnO:B interface.	B @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
Meanwhile, hopping conduction is obtained at negative bias voltage due to the defective traps in ZnO:B in which the trap energy level is lower than the energy barrier at the Ni/ZnO:B interface.	B @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
This suggests that no single-level traps, but only multiple-level traps, exist in the amorphous ZnO:B films.	B @DOPANT@ ZnO @BASEMAT@ @DBR@

Compared to bare carbonaceous materials produced from glucose, reticulated N-doped carbonaceous spheres exhibit higher efficiency in the removal of Cr(VI), where the doping of element nitrogen led to electrostatic attraction between protonated nitrogen and chromium ions, and reticulated structure created relatively higher surface area and pore volume, facilitating materials to contact with Cr(VI) ions.

Efficient second-harmonic generation from polarized thulium-doped fiber laser with periodically poled MgO:LiNbO 3.	thulium @DOPANT@ fiber laser @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
We present an efficient method for polarized 963nm emission based on second-harmonic generation from a high-power, polarized thulium-doped fiber laser using periodically poled MgO:LiNbO3 as the nonlinear material.	thulium @DOPANT@ fiber laser @BASEMAT@ @DBR@ MgO @DOPANT@ LiNbO3 @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
First, to obtain relatively low contact resistance compared to the FM/MgO/Ge contacts, we introduce the formation of high-quality FM/Ge heterointerfaces with a phosphorus δ-doped Ge layer, where the atomic arrangement matching at the interface between the (1 1 1) surface of body-centered cubic FMs and Ge(1 1 1) is important.	phosphorus @DOPANT@ Ge layer @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
Morphology-controlled facile surfactant-free synthesis of 3D flower-like BiOI:Eu3+ or Tb3+ microarchitectures and their photoluminescence properties.	Eu3+ @DOPANT@ 3D flower-like BiOI @BASEMAT@ @DBR@ Tb3+ @DOPANT@ 3D flower-like BiOI @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
Three-dimensional (3D) flower-like bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) and Eu3+ or Tb3+ ions single-doped BiOI microarchitectures were successfully synthesized by a facile and eco-friendly wet chemical method in an ethylene glycol solvent.

The photoluminescence (PL) properties were analyzed for the Eu3+ or Tb3+ single-doped BiOI 3D flower-like microarchitectures.	Eu3+ @DOPANT@ BiOI 3D flower-like microarchitectures @BASEMAT@ @DBR@ Tb3+ @DOPANT@ BiOI 3D flower-like microarchitectures @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
The PL emission spectra of BiOI:Eu3+ samples showed intense red emission peak at 616 nm due to the 5D0 → 7F2 electronic transition of Eu3+ ions under 255 nm excitation.	Eu3+ @DOPANT@ BiOI @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
Similarly, under 253 nm (f → d transition) excitation, the PL emission spectra of BiOI:Tb3+ samples exhibited intense green emission peak at 545 nm corresponding to the f → f transitions of Tb3+ ions.	Tb3+ @DOPANT@ BiOI @BASEMAT@ @DBR@
Additionally, the temperature-dependent PL emission spectra were studied for the optimized BiOI:0.07Eu3+ and BiOI:0.02Tb3+ samples, indicating good thermal stability.	0.07Eu3+ @DOPANT@ BiOI @BASEMAT@ @DBR@ 0.02Tb3+ @DOPANT@ BiOI @BASEMAT@ @DBR@

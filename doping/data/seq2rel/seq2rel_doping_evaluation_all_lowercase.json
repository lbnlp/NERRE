simulate the non-linear transport of electrons inside the semiconductor bulk.All possible scattering events of hot electrons in the medium, the main details of the band structure, as well as the heating effects, are taken into account.The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise.The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field.Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations.Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise.This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response.In particular, the correlation time of the electric field fluctuations appears to be crucial both for the noise reduction effect and the appearance of an

As-doped CdTe using high-purity single crystal wafers to investigate the mechanisms that limit p-Type doping.Two As-doped CdTe with varying acceptor density and two undoped CdTe were grown in Cd-rich and Te-rich environments.The defect structures were investigated by thermoelectric-effect spectroscopy (TEES), and first-principles calculations were used for identifying and assigning the experimentally observed defects.Measurements revealed activation of As is very low in both As-doped samples with very short lifetimes indicating strong compensation and the presence of significant carrier trapping defects.Defect studies suggest two acceptors and one donor level were introduced by As doping with activation energies at ~88 meV, ~293 meV and ~377 meV.In particular, the peak shown at ~162 K in the TEES spectra is very prominent in both As-doped samples, indicating a signature of AX-center donors.The AX-centers are believed to be responsible for most of the compensation because

ordered mesoporous carbon (NSOMC).A high electrochemical double-layer (EDL) capacitance of 351\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 was observed for the reported NSHPC electrodes, and the capacitance remains at 288\u00a0F\u00a0g\u22121 even under a large current density of 20\u00a0A\u00a0g\u22121.Besides the high specific capacitance and outstanding rate capability, symmetrical supercapacitor cell based on

Through detailed experiments, it has been deduced that ultraviolet (UV) light is a major factor in the degradation of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance due to generation of surface defects in nanoporous TiO2 and dye structural modification with free radical formation. We describe a simple spray deposition method to coat europium doped yttrium vanadate (YVO4:Eu3+) down-shifting (DS) phosphor nanoparticles (NPs) on the front side of DSSCs in order to enhance photocurrent and mitigate UV induced degradation. The nanophosphor provides an enhancement in short-wavelength spectral response of solar cells, and long-term stability is also improved under illumination, due to down-shifting of high energy UV photons to the visible region.

The optimum preparation conditions of NS-MAG particles were researched and determined. Then the permeation fluxes of NS-MAG/PSF membranes with different doping amount of NS-MAG particles were tested. NS-MAG/PSF membrane, SiO2/PSF membrane, and PSF membrane were prepared respectively. These membranes were characterized by testing the tensile strength and the permeation flux. The results show that doping NS-MAG particles can better enhance the tensile strength and permeation flux of PSF membrane. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", "doping_sentences": [{"sentence_text": "Preparation of Nonstoichiometric Silica with Multi-Active Groups and Effect of Its Doping on Polysulfone Membrane Capabilities.", "sentence_cems": ["Silica", "Polysulfone"], "relevant": true, "llm_completion": " The host 'Polysulfone Membrane' was doped.\n", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-7.224551e-06, -1.5925843e-05, -1.1430258e-06, -0.0020462505, -3.076318e-07, -4.0040345e-06, -6.827632e-08, -7.064452e-05, -1.1430258e-06, -3.076318e-07, -9.055464e-07, -1.8841804e-07, -1.2946569e-05, -2.2958224e-05, -0.00035836172, -1.8841804e-07, -0.00021836943, -6.2699432e-06, -0.037266925, -1.748335, -0.020557305, 0, -0.14272209, -0.00035502107], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": [" The", " host", " '", "Poly", "s", "ulf", "one", " Mem", "br", "ane", "'", " was", " d", "oped", ".", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF", " INFORMATION", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF"]}, {"sentence_text": "Nonstoichiometric silica with multi-active groups particles (NS-MAG particles) were first synthesized, and then added to the porous matrix of PSF to prepare a NS-MAG/PSF composite membrane through a phase inversion process.", "sentence_cems": ["silica"], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "The optimum preparation conditions of NS-MAG particles were researched and determined.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "Then the permeation fluxes of NS-MAG/PSF membranes with different doping amount of NS-MAG particles were tested.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": true, "llm_completion": " The host 'PSF' was doped with 'NS-MAG'.\n", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-0.00072435196, -1.6521892e-05, -6.6619094e-07, -4.721163e-06, -4.277735e-07, -0.13430421, -3.076318e-07, -1.1991961e-05, -1.5448071e-05, -3.076318e-07, -3.076318e-07, -9.38949e-05, -1.8841804e-07, -6.031526e-06, -0.00032407563, -1.7400124e-06, -0.00027256247, -6.031526e-06, -0.003203356, -1.1108317, -0.08110255, -6.827632e-08, -0.92322755, -0.00029664824], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": [" The", " host", " '", "PS", "F", "'", " was", " d", "oped", " with", " '", "NS", "-", "MAG", "'.", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF", " INFORMATION", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF"]}, {"sentence_text": "NS-MAG/PSF membrane, SiO2/PSF membrane, and PSF membrane were prepared respectively.", "sentence_cems": ["SiO2"], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "These membranes were characterized by testing the tensile strength and the permeation flux.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "The results show that doping NS-MAG particles can better enhance the tensile strength and permeation flux of PSF membrane.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": true, "llm_completion": " The host 'PSF membrane' was doped with 'NS-MAG particles'.\n", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-1.6642034e-05, -1.1991961e-05, -1.8841804e-07, -0.0041069877, -3.076318e-07, -0.00040916432, -1.8841804e-07, -6.827632e-08, -1.44972155e-05, -0.00010581859, 0, -3.076318e-07, -2.3078366e-05, -6.6619094e-07, -1.1991961e-05, -0.011904692, -1.9765537e-06, -1.1430258e-06, -0.00045310915, -1.7834122e-05, -0.010736641, -0.8567018, -0.006374949, -0.05447215], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": [" The", " host", " '", "PS", "F", " membrane", "'", " was", " d", "oped", " with", " '", "NS", "-", "MAG", " particles", "'.", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF", " EX", "TR", "ACTION"]}, {"sentence_text": "\u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}]}, {"doi": "10.1016/S0927-0248(02)00242-8", "title": "Structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of screen-printed and sintered (CdS)\n                  x\n               (ZnS)1\u2212x\n                (0<x<1) films", "text": "Sulfides of zinc and cadmium have been used effectively in various optolectronic devices and recently as photocatalysts in the production of molecular hydrogen in photoelectrochemical processes.

We systematically studied defect structures in As-doped CdTe using high-purity single crystal wafers to investigate the mechanisms that limit p-Type doping. Two As-doped CdTe with varying acceptor density and two undoped CdTe were grown in Cd-rich and Te-rich environments. The defect structures were investigated by thermoelectric-effect spectroscopy (TEES), and first-principles calculations were used for identifying and assigning the experimentally observed defects. Measurements revealed activation of As is very low in both As-doped samples with very short lifetimes indicating strong compensation and the presence of significant carrier trapping defects. Defect studies suggest two acceptors and one donor level were introduced by As doping with activation energies at ~88 meV, ~293 meV and ~377 meV. In particular, the peak shown at ~162 K in the TEES spectra is very prominent in both As-doped samples, indicating a signature of AX-center donors. The AX-centers are believed to be responsible for most of the compensation because of their low formation energy and very prominent peak intensity in TEES spectra.", "doping_sentences":

Both the X-rays and H+(0.71MeV),He+(4.6 and 27MeV),N+(16MeV) ion beams were used for irradiation of the crystals studied. Optical absorption spectra of KDP were measured after irradiation with various H+ ion beam doses, and accumulation of the radiation-induced defects was estimated. Considerations of the radiation effects in these crystals under irradiation with the ion beams were made taking into account the results of Monte Carlo simulations using the TRIM computer codes.

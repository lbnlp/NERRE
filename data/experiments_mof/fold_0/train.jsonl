{"prompt": "Performance comparison of adsorption isotherm models for supercritical hydrogen sorption on MOFs\nModeling of adsorption on porous material plays a crucial role in providing a better understanding of adsorption phenomena, isotherms, and isosteric heats, and predicting the thermodynamics of adsorption-based storage systems. In this work, the multicomponent potential theory of adsorption (MPTA) coupled with the modified Dubinin potential (MDP), the modified Dubinin\u2013Astakhov (DA) model, and the Unilan model are compared for their effectiveness in nonlinear least square fitting of experimental hydrogen adsorption data on three prototypical metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) in two temperature ranges: 30K\u2014room temperature (RT) for MOF-5, and 77K\u2014RT for MOF-5, Cu-BTC, and MIL-101. The ability of each model to accurately describe excess adsorption is found to depend on the pore size and the energetic pore heterogeneity of MOFs, and the latter's relation to the assumptions used within each model. The simpler Langmuir-like Unilan model complies best with the monolayer type adsorption mechanism in MOFs with large pores and homogenous pore distribution, such as in MOF-5, while the pore filling models like modified DA and MPTA\u2013MDP better represent the adsorption phenomena in MOFs with smaller pores and heterogeneous pore distributions, such as Cu-BTC and MIL-101.

{"prompt": "Zirconium-based metal organic frameworks: Highly selective adsorbents for removal of phosphate from water and urine\nPhosphate is one of the most concerning compounds in wastewater streams and a main nutrient that causes eutrophication. To eliminate the phosphate pollution, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are proposed in this study as adsorbents to remove phosphate from water. The zirconium-based MOF, UiO-66, was selected as representative MOF given its exceptional stability in water. To investigate the effect of an amine functional group, UiO-66-NH2 was also prepared using an amine-substituted ligand. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm reveal that UiO-66-NH2 exhibited higher adsorption capacities than UiO-66 possibly due to the amine group. However, the interaction between phosphate and zirconium sites of UiO MOFs might be the primary factor accounting for the phosphate adsorption to UiO MOFs. UiO MOFs also exhibited a high selectivity towards phosphate over other anions such as bromate, nitrite and nitrate. Furthermore, UiO MOFs were found to adsorb phosphate and to completely remove diluted phosphate in urine. We also found that UiO MOFs could be easily regenerated and re-used for phosphate adsorption.

The iron-based MOFs exhibit at least five orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity and significantly smaller charge activation energies across all different MOF families studied here and stand out materials made from all other metal ions considered here. We attribute the unique electrical properties of iron-based MOFs to the high-energy valence electrons of Fe2+ and the Fe3+/2+ mixed valency.

{"prompt": "Computational assessment of MOF membranes for CH4/H2 separations\nMOFs have received significant attention as gas separation membranes due to their wide range of pore sizes, permanent porosities and high surface areas. Thousands of MOFs have been reported to date. However, membrane performance of only a small number of MOFs has been experimentally reported since fabrication of thin-film MOF membranes is challenging. In this study, we used atomically-detailed simulations to assess membrane-based CH4/H2 separation performances of 172 different MOF structures. Adsorption selectivity, diffusion selectivity, membrane selectivity and gas permeability of MOFs were calculated using atomically-detailed simulations to identify the most promising membrane materials. Our results show that a significant number of MOF membranes exhibits high CH4 selectivity over H2 and a small number of MOF membranes exhibits mediocre H2 selectivity over CH4. Gas permeabilities and selectivities of MOF membranes were compared with traditional membranes such as polymers and zeolites. Several MOFs were identified to exceed the upper bound established for polymeric membranes and many MOF membranes showed higher gas permeabilities and selectivities than zeolites LTA, ITQ-29 and MFI. We also carried out flexible molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of MOF's flexibility on the predicted membrane performance. Considering flexibility of the framework made a negligible effect on the gas permeability and selectivity of the material having large pores whereas more pronounced changes were seen in gas permeabilities of the material having narrow pores.

A series of novel C-N dual-doped Cr2O3 photocatalysts were synthesized from a chromium-containing MOF material, MIL-101(Cr), using a two-step method, including initial carbonization in nitrogen atmosphere without adding any carbon source and subsequent calcination in air. The physical and photophysical properties of the C-N dual-doped Cr2O3 photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microcopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), time-resolved PL decay (TRPL) and surface photovoltage (SPV). The results showed that the nitrogen atmosphere used in the carbonization process provided the nitrogen dopant and the organic ligands in the MOF acted as the carbon source in the dual-doped process. Carbon and nitrogen elements were doped in the Cr2O3 samples, which adopted substitutional rather than interstitial doping. In the process of synthesis, carbonization temperature was a crucial factor, which determined the doping amounts of the two elements as well as the crystallinities and morphologies of the as-prepared samples.

{"prompt": "How Does CO2 React with Styrene Oxide in Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74? Catalytic Mechanisms Proposed by QM/MM Calculations\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. We report a QM/MM computational study of the cycloaddition between carbon dioxide (CO2) and styrene oxide in two different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74, to obtain atomic-level insights into the catalytic mechanism. The results suggest that both reactions begin by forming Lewis acid-base pairs between the epoxide and an open metal site and between CO2 and a phenolate moiety in the linker. Consequently, higher electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivities are conferred on the epoxide and CO2 (CO2(A)), respectively, thereby facilitating the initial ring-opening of the epoxide moiety. The ring-opening process is followed by the adsorption of a second CO2 molecule (CO2(B)), which is necessary for the subsequent ring closure to occur. In the case of Co-MOF-74, the binding of CO2(B) to the alkoxide oxygen increases the flexibility of the substrate moiety, enabling the cyclization pathway in which CO2(A) is incorporated into the final product. In contrast, the carbonate intermediate in the Mg-MOF-74-catalyzed reaction undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form a 5-membered cyclic product. During this step, CO2(A) behaves essentially as a cocatalyst and is released back into the framework upon product formation.

{"prompt": "Molecular simulations of MOF membranes for separation of ethane/ethene and ethane/methane mixtures\n\u00a9 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Metal organic framework (MOF) membranes have been widely investigated for gas separation applications. Several MOFs have been recently examined for selective separation of C2H6. Considering the large number of available MOFs, it is not possible to fabricate and test the C2H6 separation performance of every single MOF membrane using purely experimental methods. In this study, we used molecular simulations to assess the membrane-based C2H6/C2H4 and C2H6/CH4 separation performances of 175 different MOF structures. This is the largest number of MOF membranes studied to date for C2H6 separation. We computed adsorption selectivity, diffusion selectivity, membrane selectivity and gas permeability of MOFs for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. Our results show that a significant number of MOF membranes are C2H6 selective for C2H6/C2H4 separation in contrast to traditional nanoporous materials. Selectivity and permeability of MOF membranes were compared with other membrane materials, such as polymers, zeolites, and carbon molecular sieves. Several MOFs were identified to exceed the upper bound established for polymeric membranes and many MOF membranes exhibited higher gas permeabilities than zeolites and carbon molecular sieves. Examining the structure-performance relations of MOF membranes revealed that MOFs with cavity diameters between 6 and 9 \u00c5, porosities lower than 0.50, and surface areas between 500-1000 m2 g-1 have high C2H6 selectivities.

{"prompt": "CO Guest Interactions in SDB-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks: A Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Investigation\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society.  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for greener carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes. SDB-based (SDB = 4,4 ' -sulfonyldibenzoate) MOFs are particularly attractive due to their remarkable gas adsorption capacity under humid conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, their CO adsorption abilities have yet to be investigated. In this report, CO-loaded PbSDB and CdSDB were characterized using variable-temperature (VT) 13 C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy. These MOFs readily captured CO, with the adsorbed CO exhibiting dynamics as indicated by the temperature-dependent changes in the SSNMR spectra. Spectral simulations revealed that the CO simultaneously undergoes a localized wobbling about the adsorption site and a nonlocalized hopping between adjacent adsorption sites. The wobbling and hopping angles were also found to be temperature-dependent. From the appearance of the VT spectra and the extracted motional data, the CO adsorption mechanism was concluded to be analogous to that of CO 2 . To gain a better understanding on the gas adsorption properties of these MOFs and their CO capture abilities, we subsequently compared the motional data to those reported for CO 2 in SDB-based MOFs and CO in MOF-74, respectively. A significant contrast in adsorption strength was observed in both cases because of the different physical properties of the guests (i.e., CO vs CO 2 ) and the MOF frameworks (i.e., SDB-based MOFs vs MOFs with open metal sites). Our results demonstrate that SSNMR spectroscopy can be employed to probe variations in binding behavior.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO\", \"CO 2 \"], \"applications\": [\"carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"PbSDB\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CdSDB\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon monoxide (CO) capture and separation processes\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

We report our latest addition to the design toolbox in reticular chemistry, namely the concept of merged nets based on merging two edge-transitive nets into a minimal edge-transitive net for the rational construction of intricate mixed-linker MOFs. In essence, a valuable net for design enclosing two edges (not related by symmetry) is rationally generated by merging two edge-transitive nets, namely (3,6)-coordinated spn and 6-coordinated hxg. The resultant merged-net, a (3,6,12)-coordinated sph net with net transitivity [32] enclosing three nodes and two distinct edges, offers potential for deliberate design of intricate mixed-linker MOFs. We report implementation of the merged-net approach for the construction of isoreticular rare-earth mixed-linker MOFs, sph-MOF-1 to -4, based on the assembly of 12-c hexanuclear carboxylate-based molecular building blocks (MBBs), displaying cuboctahedral building units, 3-c tritopic ligands, and 6-c hexatopic ligands.

{"prompt": "Atomistic Simulation of Protein Encapsulation in Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Fabrication of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with large apertures triggers a brand-new research area for selective encapsulation of biomolecules within MOF nanopores. The underlying inclusion mechanism is yet to be clarified however. Here we report a molecular dynamics study on the mechanism of protein encapsulation in MOFs. Evaluation for the binding of amino acid side chain analogues reveals that van der Waals interaction is the main driving force for the binding and that guest size acts as a key factor predicting protein binding with MOFs. Analysis on the conformation and thermodynamic stability of the miniprotein Trp-cage encapsulated in a series of MOFs with varying pore apertures and surface chemistries indicates that protein encapsulation can be achieved via maintaining a polar/nonpolar balance in the MOF surface through tunable modification of organic linkers and Mg-O chelating moieties. Such modifications endow MOFs with a more biocompatible confinement. This work provides guidelines for selective inclusion of biomolecules within MOFs and facilitates MOF functions as a new class of host materials and molecular chaperones.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"encapsulation of biomolecules\", \"selective encapsulation\", \"protein encapsulation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Electronic Properties of Bimetallic Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs): Tailoring the Density of Electronic States through MOF Modularity\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society.  The development of porous well-defined hybrid materials (e.g., metal-organic frameworks or MOFs) will add a new dimension to a wide number of applications ranging from supercapacitors and electrodes to \"smart\" membranes and thermoelectrics. From this perspective, the understanding and tailoring of the electronic properties of MOFs are key fundamental challenges that could unlock the full potential of these materials. In this work, we focused on the fundamental insights responsible for the electronic properties of three distinct classes of bimetallic systems, M x-y M\u2032 y -MOFs, M x M\u2032 y -MOFs, and M x (ligand-M\u2032 y )-MOFs, in which the second metal (M\u2032) incorporation occurs through (i) metal (M) replacement in the framework nodes (type I), (ii) metal node extension (type II), and (iii) metal coordination to the organic ligand (type III), respectively. We employed microwave conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, pressed-pellet conductivity, and theoretical modeling to shed light on the key factors responsible for the tunability of MOF electronic structures. Experimental prescreening of MOFs was performed based on changes in the density of electronic states near the Fermi edge, which was used as a starting point for further selection of suitable MOFs. As a result, we demonstrated that the tailoring of MOF electronic properties could be performed as a function of metal node engineering, framework topology, and/or the presence of unsaturated metal sites while preserving framework porosity and structural integrity. These studies unveil the possible pathways for transforming the electronic properties of MOFs from insulating to semiconducting, as well as provide a blueprint for the development of hybrid porous materials with desirable electronic structures.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"supercapacitors\", \"electrodes\", \"membranes\", \"thermoelectrics\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The composites were characterized by various techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurement through nitrogen adsorption at cryogenic temperature. Single component adsorption isotherm measurements of CO2, CH4 and N2 were performed at different temperatures. The selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 were estimated on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). MOF-505@GO composites showed higher porosity and enhanced CO2 adsorption compared to its parent compound MOF-505. MOF-505@5GO exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 3.94mmol/g at 298K and 100kPa, having an increase of 37.3% in comparison with the parent MOF-505. The significant improvement of CO2 uptakes could be attributed to not only new micropores and unsaturated metal sites formed in the MOF-505@GO, but also enhanced surface dispersive forces of the composites. The experimental adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4 and N2 were well fitted with dual site Langmuir-Freundlich (DSLF) model. The CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 adsorption selectivities were up to 8.6 and 37.2 at 298K and 100kPa, respectively, predicted by IAST.

{"prompt": "Recent progresses in the size and structure control of MOF supported noble metal catalysts\nThe preparation, characterization and application of metal organic framework (MOF) supported noble metal catalysts have drawn a great interest with the rapid progresses in the syntheses of MOFs and MOF based composites. There are several principal objectives for the investigation of MOF supported catalysts, including (1) the designable frameworks provide us a very clear model for the fundamental catalytic studies; (2) the extremely large surface area and the extremely high porosity of MOFs are always attractive for the catalytic applications; (3) the designable or the controllable porous structure with uniform pore size is excellent for the preparation of designable catalyst, a dream of chemists and chemical engineers worldwide; (4) the MOFs can be easily modified by various functional groups; (5) MOF based composites (with graphene and other materials) can be easily fabricated; (6) the needs for novel catalysts keep growing; (7) the member of the MOF family increases remarkably recently with the improvement of thermal and chemical stability of MOFs; (8) the hybrid of noble metal catalysts and MOFs is leading to many unusual catalytic properties. In this perspective, we summarize the recent advances in the preparation and application of MOF supported noble metal catalysts. To prepare this kind of new catalysts, two general methods have been reported: the precursor way and the metal nanoparticle way. The former is based on metal ions or metal precursors like inorganic salt (nitrate or chloride) or metallorganic compound. The metal ions or metal precursors have to be loaded into the MOF framework via chemical vapor infiltration, solution impregnation and incipient wetness infiltration or to be pre-incorporated on the organic linkers before the synthesis of MOF. The second way is based on the pre-synthesized metal nanoparticles. To do so, the pre-synthesized metal nanoparticles have to be directly involved in the synthesis of MOFs from the beginning. The characteristics of two ways have been discussed. Because of the unique properties and the structure of MOFs, the loading of metal or metal ion with the assistance of organic solvent is very helpful for the confinement of nanoparticles within the cavities of MOF frameworks or for control of size and location of nanoparticles. The structure control of catalyst together with size and location control still remains a significant challenge.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalysts\", \"catalytic\", \"designable catalysts\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

MOFs 1\u20133 are stable in pH = 5\u201311, 2\u201311, 3\u201311 aqueous solution respectively for at least 24 h at room temperature. Although H4TCS absorbs only UV light, MOFs 1\u20133 absorb both UV and visible light in broad ranges (250\u2013800 nm) and absorb more visible light than the ligand BPY. The rapid anodic photocurrent responses of MOFs 1\u20133 under UV and visible light illumination were observed. The photocurrent densities increase in the order of MOF 3 < 1 < 2 under visible light illumination (430 nm). The band gaps of MOFs 1\u20133 determined based on UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and electrochemical (EC) analysis are 1.28, 1.35 and 0.67 eV, respectively. MOF 1 is able to photocatalyze the reduction of CO2 to CH4 under visible light, producing CH4 (1.44 \u03bcmol g\u22121 in 8 h), which is unprecedented in MOFs. The catalytic activity of MOF 1 (0.75 \u03bcmol g\u22121 after 4 h) under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp is significantly better than those of MOFs 2 and 3 (0.14 \u03bcmol g\u22121 after 4 h). The band structures, density of states and band gaps of MOFs 1\u20133 were calculated by the GGA-PBE and GGA-PBE+U method implemented in VASP code. The calculations show that all the three compounds can be viewed as bulk intermediate band (IB) materials. The density of states of the IB in MOF 1 is high, which could suppress the non-radiative recombination. The density of states of the IB levels in MOFs 2 and 3 are low, making these levels very effective recombination centres, thus jeopardizing the photocatalytic activities of MOFs 2 and 3. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental results and explain the photocatalytic activity differences. This study is the first to successfully address the question of how the types of unpaired electron containing electron-rich metal ions (i.e. Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II)) affect the band gaps and band structures of MOFs and thus their photoelectronic properties.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"[M2(TCS)(BPY)] (M = Co(1), Ni(2) and Cu(3); H4TCS = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) silane, BPY = 4,4\\u2032-bipyridine)\", \"mof_description\": [\"water-stable isostructural metal\\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic activities\", \"reduction of CO2 to CH4\", \"photocatalyze\", \"photoelectronic properties\", \"photocatalytic activity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Transforming metal\u2013organic frameworks into functional materials\nThis review focuses on a new alternative approach towards MOF preparation through the transformation of known MOF structures into other novel, more active MOFs that, in most cases, could not be obtained by conventional synthetic methods. These transformations are usually of the single-crystal-to-single-crystal type, usually accompanied by a modification of the dimensionality of the MOFs: e.g., 1D \u2192 2D, 2D \u2192 3D, 1D \u2192 3D or even 3D \u2192 3D\u2032 (concerning modification of the connectivity of the primary building units). The literature contains several reports concerning MOF-to-MOF transformations but only in a handful of cases the authors aimed to design new functional compounds, pointing towards applications or the modification (or improvement) of the properties of the materials. This review aims to concisely describe the most significant reports concerning the transformation of MOFs into other more functional and active MOFs. Several types of transformations are possible including solvent removal or insertion, modification of the pH, metal exchange, release of active molecules, among others. These transformations can lead to significant improvements of the properties of MOFs, for example: increase of adsorption of different gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide; creation of sensing centers for different chemical species; pH sensing with, in some cases, a concomitant change in crystal color; improvement of the luminescence properties by the removal of solvent molecules.

Four multifunctional MOFs, with a wide variety of dimensionality, porosity and surface characteristics were exploited for this purpose. The unique bis-bidentate nature of the ligand with two chelating compartments along with a semi-rigid backbone leads to some interesting chiral MOFs. Detail self-assembly studies reveals that both helicity as well as local environments around the metal centres are responsible for chirality. A detailed investigation shows the importance of these materials as chiral zeolite analogues for environmental remediation. The much improved photocatalytic degradation of a representative toxic dye molecule highlights the advantages of MOFs over the usual metal oxide based semiconductors as remediation materials.

{"prompt": "Characteristic features of molecular transport in MOF ZIF-8 as revealed by IR microimaging\nIn this study differences in the diffusion characteristics of several small molecules in MOF ZIF-8 were examined. The diffusion data were obtained using the technique of IR microscopy by investigating individual crystals. Most of the primary data were already published separately but are revisited here, complemented with new data and discussed together as a mini-review on the diffusion characteristics. The range of the reported diffusivities covers six orders of magnitude. This study was only possible owing to the particularly wide range of crystal sizes, from 20 up to 300 \u03bcm, available for the diffusion experiments. Different features in the loading dependencies are identified. They reflect a large variety of mechanisms which dominate the mass transfer within the pores, including window blocking effects and molecular clustering. It is demonstrated that the diffusion characteristics may change significantly if a small molecule like methane diffuses in a mixture with other guests. However, this is not a general feature of the system as for larger molecules like ethane and ethene no difference in the mixture was found compared to the single compound. Hence, predictions solely based on single-component data like membrane separation factors may differ notably from the real performance. On the basis of diffusivity measurements with small alcohols the validity of the Darken relation is demonstrated and found to provide a quantitative tool to correlate transport and self-diffusivity in this host system.

Yet poor conductivity in most MOFs largely thwarts their capacitance and/or rate performance. In this work, an effective strategy was developed to reduce the bulk electric resistance of MOFs by interweaving MOF crystals with polyaniline (PANI) chains that are electrochemically deposited on MOFs.

Permeability and selectivity of MOF membranes can be accurately calculated using \u2018the detailed method\u2019 which computes transport diffusivities of gases in MOFs' pores. However, this method is computationally demanding therefore not suitable to screen large numbers of MOFs. Another approach is to use \u2018the approximate method\u2019 which uses self-diffusivities of gases to predict gas permeabilities of MOF membranes. The approximate method requires fewer amounts of time compared to the detailed method but significantly underestimates gas permeabilities since mixture correlation effects are ignored in this method. In this work, we first used computationally demanding detailed method to calculate permeabilities and selectivities of 8 different MOF membranes for Xe/Kr and Xe/Ar separations. We then compared these results with the predictions of the approximate method. After observing significant underestimation of the gas permeabilities by the approximate method, we proposed a new computational method to accurately predict gas separation properties of MOF membranes. This new method requires the same computational time and resources with the approximate method but makes much more accurate predictions for gas permeabilities.

The ideal selectivity of CO2/N2 was enhanced significantly in the Cu-MOF/POZ MMM, compared to that in a pristine POZ asymmetric membrane.

To improve the thermal properties of these materials, we have prepared a series of high-density MOF-5 composites containing 0-10 wt % expanded natural graphite (ENG), which serves as a thermal conduction enhancer. The addition of 10 wt % ENG to MOF-5 and compaction to 0.5 g/cm 3 was previously found to increase the thermal conductivity relative to neat MOF-5 of the same density by a factor of 5. In this study, detailed measurements of the hydrogen storage behavior of MOF-5/ENG composites between 77 and 295 K are reported. We find that MOF-5 pellets with 0 wt % ENG and a density of 0.5 g/cm 3 have a total volumetric hydrogen storage density at 77 K and 100 bar that is 23% larger than powder MOF-5 and 41% larger than cryo-compressed hydrogen.

However, such composites typically exhibit low catalytic efficiency, due to the slow diffusion of the reactants in the long and narrow channels of the MOF shell. In order to improve the catalytic efficiency of these systems, here we report the fabrication of NPs incorporated in nanosized MOFs (NPs@nano-MOFs), obtained by reducing the size of the MOF crystals grown around the NPs. The crystal size of the composites was controlled by modulating the nucleation rate of the MOFs during the encapsulation of pre-synthesized and catalytically active NPs; in this way, NPs@MOF crystals smaller than 50 nm were synthesized and subsequently used as highly efficient catalysts. Due to the shorter path from the MOF surface to the active sites, the obtained Pt@nano-MOFs composites showed a higher conversion rate than their larger-sized counterparts in the synthesis of imines via cascade reaction of nitrobenzene and in the hydrogenation of olefins, while retaining the excellent size and shape selectivity associated with the molecular sieving effect of the MOF layer.

Notably, upon exposure to 1 ppm acetone in air, the composites still can express an apparent response (Rgas/R0 = 4.06).

The Co3O4 nanostructures uniformly distributed in 3D FGH frameworks can easily adsorb a great amount of acetone gas molecules through the unique porous frameworks and produce a great deal of electrons, which can be transferred to the p-type FGH frameworks through Co3O4/FGH junctions so that the resistance of Co3O4/FGH composites is greatly increased.

{"prompt": "ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Water Stability of Interpenetrated Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) have been performed to elucidate the underlying water-induced disruption mechanism of several prototypical interpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-9, IRMOF-13, and SUMOF-4). Through the comparison to the corresponding noninterpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-10 and IRMOF-14), for both the interpenetrated and noninterpenetrated MOFs, structural collapse was always accompanied by the dissociation of the water molecules, with the produced OH- and H+ forming chemical bonds with the Zn2+ ion and O atom of the ligand, respectively. However, the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs is less than that of the corresponding noninterpenetrated structures. The reasons for the differences between the MOFs in the resistance to water attack are clarified. The water resistance of the noninterpenetrated MOFs is mainly attributed to the strength of the Zn-Oligand, but, the hydrogen bond has little effect. However, a trade-off between the strength of the Zn-Oligand bond and the hydrogen bond determines the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs. We expect that our understanding of the water-disruption mechanisms of MOFs will provide helpful guidance for the design of MOFs with a high water-resistance.

Because there is a practically unlimited number of different MOFs, which vary in their pore geometry and chemical composition, it is challenging to find the best MOF for a given application. Here, we applied high-throughput computational methods to rapidly explore thousands of possible MOFs, given a library of starting materials, in the context of Xe/Kr separation. We generated over 137\u2006000 structurally diverse hypothetical MOFs from a library of chemical building blocks and screened them for Xe/Kr separation. For each MOF, we calculated geometric properties via Delaunay tessellation and predicted thermodynamic Xe/Kr adsorption behavior via multicomponent grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we calculated the pore limiting diameter, largest cavity diameter, accessible void volume, as well as xenon and krypton adsorption at 1.0, 5.0 and 10 bar at 273 K. From these data we show that MOFs with pores just large enough to fit a single xenon atom, and having morphologies resembling tubes of uniform width, are ideal for Xe/Kr separation. Finally, we compare our generated MOFs to several known structures (IRMOF-1, HKUST-1, ZIF-8, Pd-MOF, & MOF-505) and conclude that significantly improved materials remain to be synthesized.

The effects of smaller pore size of T-MOF- 5 and more ZnO molecules in T-MOF-5, on the H2 and CO2 permeation properties of C-MOF-5/CA and T-MOF-5/CA MMMs were investigated. The all novel MMMs were prepared using the solution casting method and characterized by FTIR, TGA and SEM. SEM images as well as results of FTIR and TGA analyses confirmed good adhesion between both MOF-5s and CA matrix. Addition of both C-MOF-5 and T-MOF-5 into the CA improved the gas transport properties of the CA, especially in H2 separation. The H2/CO2 selectivity continued the increasing trend at 9 wt % and did not significantly reduce even at 12 wt % due to good adhesion between both MOF-5s and CA. The highest H2/CO2 selectivity was obtained at 12 and 9 wt % loading of C-MOF-5 and T-MOF-5, respectively. By changing the filler from C-MOF-5 to T-MOF-5, the increasing and reducing of adsorption site of H2and CO2 (respectively), and also reducing in pore size, caused the appearance of H2 permeability to not change much but the CO2 permeability to reduce. Accordingly, the H2/CO2 selectivity in all T-MOF-5/CA MMMs is higher than that in all C-MOF-5/CA MMMs. According to obtained results, the activated MOFs (i.e., C-MOF-5 in this study) are not always the best choices for separation process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cubic and tetragonal structures\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"H2/CO2 separation\", \"separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"C-MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cubic structures\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"H2/CO2 separation\", \"separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"T-MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"tetragonal structures\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"H2/CO2 separation\", \"separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which contain reactive metal clusters and organic ligands allowing for large porosities and surface areas, have proven effective in gas adsorption, separations, and catalysis. MOFs are most commonly synthesized as bulk powder, requiring additional processes to adhere them to functional devices and fabrics that risk decreasing the powder porosity and adsorption capacity. Here, we demonstrate a method of first coating fabrics with metal oxide films using atomic layer deposition (ALD). This process creates conformal films of controllable thickness on each fiber, while providing a more reactive surface for MOF nucleation. By submerging the ALD coated fabric in solution during solvothermal MOF synthesis, the MOFs create a conformal, well-adhered coating on the fibers, resulting in a MOF-functionalized fabric, without additional adhesion materials that may block MOF pores and functional sites. Here we demonstrate two solvothermal synthesis methods. First, we form a MIL-96(Al) layer on polypropylene fibers using synthetic conditions that convert the metal oxide to MOF. Using initial inorganic films of varying thicknesses, diffusion of the organic linker into the inorganic allows us to control the extent of MOF loading on the fabric. Second, we perform a solvothermal synthesis of UiO-66-NH2in which the MOF nucleates on the conformal metal oxide coating on polyamide-6 (PA-6) fibers, thereby producing a uniform and conformal thin film of MOF on the fabric. The resulting materials can be directly incorporated into filter devices or protective clothing and eliminate the maladroit qualities of loose powder.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-96\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption\", \"separations\", \"catalysis\", \"incorporated into filter devices or protective clothing\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-96(Al)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption\", \"separations\", \"catalysis\", \"incorporated into filter devices or protective clothing\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption\", \"separations\", \"catalysis\", \"incorporated into filter devices or protective clothing\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

MOFs belonging to this family consist of M2+ ions coordinated to hexatopic organic linkers containing three coplanar isophthalate-based moieties. rht-MOFs are a promising platform of MOFs because they display open-metal sites through the [M2(O2CR)4] clusters, high surface areas, and tunable pore sizes and chemical functionalities. They have been shown to exhibit high uptake for various energy-related gases, such as H2 and CO2. Detailed insights into the gas sorption mechanisms and binding sites in these MOFs can be made by way of experimental techniques, including neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and electronic structure calculations. In this highlight, we review the important experimental and theoretical studies that have been performed to investigate the favorable gas sorption sites in these MOFs.

{"prompt": "Impact of Disordered Guest-Framework Interactions on the Crystallography of Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society. It is a general and common practice to carry out single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments at cryogenic temperatures in order to obtain high-resolution data. In this report, we show that this practice is not always applicable to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), especially when these structures are highly porous. Specifically, two new MOFs are reported here, MOF-1004 and MOF-1005, for which the collection of the diffraction data at lower temperature (100 K) did not give data of sufficient quality to allow structure solution. However, collection of data at higher temperature (290 K) gave atomic-resolution data for MOF-1004 and MOF-1005, allowing for structure solution. We find that this inverse behavior, contrary to normal practice, is also true for some well-established MOFs (MOF-177 and UiO-67). Close examination of the X-ray diffraction data obtained for all four of these MOFs at various temperatures led us to conclude that disordered guest-framework interactions play a profound role in introducing disorder at low temperature, and the diminishing strength of these interactions at high temperatures reduces the disorder and gives high-resolution diffraction data.

Herein, an effective integrated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bioprobe was constructed based on F-couSiPc as co-reaction accelerator of tris (2,2\u2032-bipyridine-n,n\u2019)-, dichloride, hexahydrate (II) (Ru(bpy)32+) and TiO2 MOFs as carrier for developing a competitive-type ECL strategy for the sensing of deoxynivalenol (DON). Initially, TiO2 MOFs with high specific surface area and regular pore structure was employed to immobilize Ru(bpy)32+ and Mercapto-beta-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), then sensitizer of F-couSiPc was introduced into the system by encapsulating into the cup-shaped cavity of \u03b2-CD, which mainly ascribed to the supermolecular self-assembly behavior, perfectly avoiding the aggregation of F-couSiPc. Due to the shortened electronic transmission distance, reduced energy loss and less reagent consumption, the integrated ECL reaction pattern between the luminescent Ru(bpy)32+ and sensitizer of F-couSiPc has shown improved luminous efficiency compared with the common intermolecular ECL reactions. Meanwhile, the (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) and carbon nanohorn (CNHs) nanohybrid (APTES-PTCA@CNHs), combing the remarkable advantages of CNHs with the desirable electronic and optical properties of PTCA, served as matrix to immobilize antigen (DON) with an increasing amount, and on account of the high affinity between the APTES and DON, a stable ECL performance was obtained. Based on the competitive immunoreactions, a facile and sensitive ECL immunosensor was constructed for the detection of DON, with excellent linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 20 ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.03 pg/mL (S/N = 3).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"TiO2 MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"sensing of deoxynivalenol\", \"detection of DON\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The molecular building block approach was employed effectively to construct a series of novel isoreticular, highly porous and stable, aluminum-based metal-organic frameworks with soc topology. From this platform, three compounds were experimentally isolated and fully characterized: namely, the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 and its naphthalene and anthracene analogues. Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits outstanding gravimetric methane uptake (total and working capacity). It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the Al-soc-MOF platform can address the challenging Department of Energy dual target of 0.5 g/g (gravimetric) and 264 cm3 (STP)/cm3 (volumetric) methane storage. Furthermore, Al-soc-MOF exhibited the highest total gravimetric and volumetric uptake for carbon dioxide and the utmost total and deliverable uptake for oxygen at relatively high pressures among all microporous MOFs. In order to correlate the MOF pore structure and functionality to the gas storage properties, to better understand the structure-property relationship, we performed a molecular simulation study and evaluated the methane storage performance of the Al-soc-MOF platform using diverse organic linkers.

{"prompt": "Experimental and numerical investigation of the cryogenic hydrogen storage processes over MOF-5\nThe processes of hydrogen charging to and discharging from a 3-L cryogenic tank have been studied experimentally and numerically. This study investigated the impacts of factors such as mass flow rate, outlet opening time, bed density, and heating power on the hydrogen charging and discharging processes. For charging, it was found that the flow-through cooling technique could remove the adsorption heat in the process, but some issues such as channeling phenomenon and large thermal mass of the system need to be addressed. Low initial bed temperature is beneficial for hydrogen storage in terms of the efficiency of charging operation. When the bed density of metal organic framework-5 (MOF-5) is increased from 164 kg/m3 to 174 kg/m3, the total storage of hydrogen within the tank increases accordingly. It is found that pressure is the major factor that determines the storage of hydrogen, which increases significantly with the pressure within the tank. For discharging, high pressure in the storage tank can be used to release hydrogen for a certain period of time without heating. However, in order to maintain the desired hydrogen discharge rate, a heat source is eventually needed. This heat must be supplied in order to desorb the additional hydrogen from the system.

The obtained host\u2013guest systems were characterised by thermogravimetry and vibrational spectroscopy and their crystal structures were elucidated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. The crystal structures indicate that guest molecules forming hydrogen-bonds with the host framework (pyrazine, methylpyrazine and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine) induce a slight opening of the channels, resulting in a semi-open framework conformation (CAU-13-so). For the bulkier guests 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, trimethylpyrazine and tetramethylpyrazine, only van der Waals interactions can be observed between the host and the guest molecules and a large pore conformation is observed (CAU-13-lp). We carried out in situ PXRD studies using synchrotron radiation during the adsorption of the respective guest molecules from aqueous solutions with various concentrations and at different temperatures. In general, stronger host\u2013guest interactions required milder adsorption conditions while harsher conditions nevertheless accelerated the conversion.

The use of alternative metal precursors would provide a more flexible and cost-effective strategy for direction- and shape-controlled MOF synthesis.

Importantly, the synthesis scheme was found to be transferrable to the production of different linker analogues of the MOF and other topologies.

The search for nanoporous materials that are highly performing for gas storage and separation is one of the contemporary challenges in material design. The computational tools to aid these experimental efforts are widely available, and adsorption isotherms are routinely computed for huge sets of (hypothetical) frameworks. Clearly the computational results depend on the interactions between the adsorbed species and the adsorbent, which are commonly described using force fields. In this paper, an extensive comparison and in-depth investigation of several force fields from literature is reported for the case of methane adsorption in the Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks UiO-66, UiO-67, DUT-52, NU-1000, and MOF-808. Significant quantitative differences in the computed uptake are observed when comparing different force fields, but most qualitative features are common which suggests some predictive power of the simulations when it comes to these properties. More insight into the host-guest interactions is obtained by benchmarking the force fields with an extensive number of ab initio computed single molecule interaction energies. This analysis at the molecular level reveals that especially ab initio derived force fields perform well in reproducing the ab initio interaction energies. Finally, the high sensitivity of uptake predictions on the underlying potential energy surface is explored.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-Based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Methane Adsorption\", \"gas storage and separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-67\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-Based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Methane Adsorption\", \"gas storage and separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DUT-52\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-Based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Methane Adsorption\", \"gas storage and separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"NU-1000\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-Based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Methane Adsorption\", \"gas storage and separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-808\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr-Based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Methane Adsorption\", \"gas storage and separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In this work, using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated adsorption isotherms of pure and binary mixtures of hydrogen-methane in two large surface area MOFs (MOF-5 and MOF-177), two catenated MOFs (IRMOF-11 and MOF-14), and a high affinity open metal site MOF with strong Zn\u03c3+-O\u03c3- dipoles on the surface that create strong energetic interaction with the adsorbates (MOF-74).

Among various class of materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising candidates for CO2 capture from flue gases. In particular, M-MOF-74, where M represents different metals, are equipped with open metal sites that can lead to very high CO2 uptake at postcombustion flue gas conditions. However, these structures are known to have poor CO2 capture performance under humid conditions as water molecules bind strongly to the unsaturated metal sites, outcompeting the CO2. In this computational study, a pore space partition strategy is employed through a symmetry-matching regulated ligand insertion within the Mg-MOF-74 and Zn-MOF-74 structures, which mitigates the deterioration effect of water. In the case of Zn-MOF-74, higher selectivity as well as larger CO2 uptake in binary mixture conditions is obtained, thereby demonstrating that reduction in the pore size of MOFs can serve as viable strategy to capture CO2 under humid postcombustion conditions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"M-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"humid conditions\", \"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"humid conditions\", \"CO2 uptake\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

However, there have been rare platforms that can vastly tune the core of nanoparticles at a molecular level despite various nanomaterials employed in such studies. Here we show targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Zr(IV)-based porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles. Through a bottom-up approach, the size of MOF nanoparticles was precisely tuned in a broad range with a designed functional motif, built upon selection of building blocks of the MOF. In particular, molecular properties of the porphyrinic linker are maintained in the MOF nanoparticles regardless of their sizes. Therefore, size-dependent cellular uptake and ensuing PDT allowed for screening of the optimal size of MOF nanoparticles for PDT while MOF nanoparticle formulation of the photosensitizer showed better PDT efficacy than that of its small molecule. Additionally, Zr6 clusters in the MOF enabled an active targeting modality through postsynthetic modification, giving even more enhanced PDT efficacy.

The catalytic activity is shown to vary across the series of MOFs due to the different extent to which each topology facilitates reactant preconcentration and alignment of PC and NAI via coordination to framework porphyrin sites (orientation effects). Trends of experimental initial reaction rates with MOF topology and PC regioisomer are consistent with preconcentration effects, which depend on the number of porphyrin sites per volume of MOF, as well as with orientation effects, which depend on the number of porphyrin pairs per volume of MOF that bind PC and NAI in such a way that they are primed to form the required transition state.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as MOF-74, can have open metal sites to which adsorbates such as CO2 preferentially bind. 13C NMR of 13CO2 is highly informative about the binding sites present in Mg-MOF-74. We used this technique to investigate loadings between ~0.88 and 1.15 molecules of CO2 per metal in Mg-MOF-74 at 295 K. 13C lineshapes recorded as a function of loading can be understood in terms of the dependence of the CO2 NMR frequency on the angle (?) with respect to the CO2 axis and the channel of the MOF, reflected in the Legendre polynomial, P2. In the fast motion limit, the NMR spectra reveal the time-averaged value of P2, where ? is the angle between the instantaneous CO2 axis and the channel axis. DFT calculations were used to determine a weighted average of P2 in this regime and are in good agreement with experimental data.

Cross-sectional TEM images show a well-defined core@shell structure of the MOF-functionalized fiber, and SEM shows a flat MOF surface texture. We analyze the thickness and mass increase data of LbL HKUST-1 MOF thin films on ALD-coated polypropylene fibers and find the growth rate to be 288\u2013290 ng cm\u22122 per LbL cycle. Unlike planar LbL MOF embodiments where adsorption capacities are difficult to quantify, the large volume quantity on a typical fiber mat enables accurate surface area measurement of these unique MOF morphologies. After 40 LbL cycles the MOFs on fibers exhibit N2 adsorption BET surface areas of up to 93.6 m2 gMOF+fiber\u22121 (\u223c535 m2 gMOF\u22121) and breakthrough test results reveal high dynamic loadings for NH3 (1.37 molNH3 kgMOF+fiber\u22121) and H2S (1.49 molH2S kgMOF+fiber\u22121). This synthesis route is applicable to many polymer fibers, and the fiber@ALD@MOF structure is promising for gas filtration, membrane separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and other applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"MOF thin films\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas filtration\", \"membrane separation\", \"catalysis\", \"chemical sensing\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Herein, the influence of certain percentage additions of MOF-5 (from 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40wt.%) into PPIA on its structure, morphology, density, and thermal stability were investigated. However, extensive damage was observed in MOF-5 structures according to PXRD, FTIR and nitrogen sorption isotherm analyses. The obtained materials were applied for CO2 capture and monitored by the volumetric method. The higher percentage of MOF-5 incorporated into PPIA induced higher CO2 adsorption. A significant increase of CO2 capture was seen after the addition of 1\u201320wt.% of MOF-5 into the PPIA, while an addition of 40wt.% of MOF-5 indicated there is no more benefit in increasing the MOF-5 concentration in the composite and reached a CO2 adsorption capacity of about 65wt.% of the adsorption value of MOF-5 only. However, the incorporation of MOF-5 into PPIA caused the thermal stability of the hybrid coating material to be lower than the original PPIA coating and the MOF-5 itself. The texture of the film after addition of about 20wt.% of MOF-5 changed from a smooth to a coarser and denser form.

{"prompt": "Molecular insight into the adsorption of H2S in the flexible MIL-53(Cr) and rigid MIL-47(V) MOFs: Infrared spectroscopy combined to molecular simulations\nThe adsorption of the acid gas H2S has been explored in both MIL-47(V) and MIL-53(Cr) porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by combining infrared measurements and molecular simulations. It is shown that while the MIL-47(V) structure remains rigid upon H2S adsorption up to a pressure of 1.8 MPa, the MIL-53(Cr) solid initially present in the large pore form (LP) switches to its narrow pore version (NP) at very low pressure before undergoing a second structural transition from the NP to the LP versions at higher pressure. Such structural transitions further explain the different shape of the adsorption isotherms for both MILs. A further step consists of providing some insights into the microscopic arrangements of the adsorbate molecules within the pores of the MILs. At the initial stage of adsorption, the H 2S molecules mainly form hydrogen bonded species, either as hydrogen donor (in MIL-47 V) or hydrogen-acceptor (in MIL-53Cr) with the \u03bc2-O and \u03bc2-OH groups, respectively, present at the MOF surfaces. At higher pressure (1.8 MPa), the adsorbates are preferentially arranged within the channel in order to form dimers with a high orientational disorder.

The multiband fluorescence derived from the characteristic emission of Eu3+ and linker-to-cluster (Eu- oxo or Zr- oxo) charge transfer (LCCT) transition was fabricated. By combination of the luminescent property with the intrinsic porosity and open sites of amine group to bind target analytes, the Eu/Zr-MOF exhibited small molecules-dependent luminescence enhancement and quench effects. Notably, a drastic enhancement of fluorescent at 465nm induced by formaldehyde was observed. Thus, a ratiometric fluorescent sensing for formaldehyde was performed based on the intensity ratio of two emission bands at 465 and 615nm for Eu/Zr-MOF. Under the excitation of 365nm, the increase in intensity ratio of the two emission bands was nearly linearly proportional to the amount of formaldehyde. By this Eu/Zr-MOF sensor, the detection limit of formaldehyde was 0.2mg/L. This sensing mechanism was ascribed to the binding interaction of free amino groups in Eu/Zr-MOF with the guest. An added electron transfer from amino group containing lone pair electrons to the positively charged formaldehyde leads to a drastic enhancement of luminescence at about 465nm, while the characteristic emission of Eu3+ at 615nm enhances slightly.

{"prompt": "Different Co-based MOFs templated synthesis of Co3O4 nanoparticles to degrade RhB by activation of oxone\n\u00a9 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. In this study, Co-based MOF with a 2D structure, 3D microrod structure and 3D nano-dodecahedral structure was synthesized by the coordination of cobalt ions and different organic ligands. Then, Co3O4, which was derived from these Co-based MOFs, was used to activate oxone for RhB degradation. It was found that the morphology and structure of the templates can significantly influence the formation of the nano Co3O4 products, which has an indirect effect on the catalytic ability of the resulting Co3O4 for oxone to degrade RhB.

In UiO-66 (Zr) the mobile phenylene fragments exhibit a complex rotational dynamics of the phenylene rings with fast librations and much slower \u03c0-flips around the C2 symmetry axis. We show that due to the intrinsic broad distribution of the \u03c0-flips rate, the relaxation process for the deuterium in the C-D group of phenylene fragment is multiexponential. Two main modes of T1 relaxation are clearly detected, corresponding to the fast T1fast and the slow T1slow relaxation. Based on the experimental observation of two-exponential relaxation, a computational model for this T1 relaxation behavior capable to reproduce the peculiarities of the MOF linkers dynamics was built. Computational analysis allows to establish that the librational motion affects mostly the T1slow, while T1fast remains unaffected by this motion. Simulation of the T1slow dependence on the libration rate klib shows that in the range of the librational frequencies of 106-109 Hz the T1slow is not sensitive to the klib variation, and therefore a precise correspondence between T1slow and klib cannot be established. T1slow exhibits a specific \"peak-like-shape\" dependence of klib in the range of 109-1012 Hz. In this range of libration frequencies an unambiguous relation between T1slow and klib exists only in a very narrow frequency window of 0.1 \u00d7 1010-5 \u00d7 1010 Hz. The best conditions to characterize the librational motion by means of T1 relaxation analysis are met when the flipping motion is almost frozen (kflip < 103 Hz) because T1slow becomes extremely sensitive to the variation of klib.\n\n###\n\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66(Zr)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66 (Zr)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "A transferable model for adsorption in mofs with unsaturated metal sites\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. The number of newly discovered metal-organic frameworks is growing exponentially. Molecular simulation is becoming increasingly important to screen large databases of structures and identify potential candidates for challenging gas separations, but such efforts rely on the availability of accurate molecular models that can predict adsorption in a wide range of different MOFs. MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) pose particular problems because standard force fields are unable to describe their specific interactions with certain adsorbates. In this Article, we demonstrate that our previous approach to describe adsorption in open metal sites, based on a combination of classical Monte Carlo simulations and quantum-mechanical Density Functional Theory calculations, is transferable to several Cu-containing MOFs. By fitting the parameters of our model to match adsorption energies of ethylene on HKUST-1 and transferring them to the Cu-paddlewheel units of other MOFs, we obtain predictions in good agreement with experimental adsorption measurements. Where agreement is not as satisfactory, we show that this can be explained by limited accessibility or diffusion through the pore network. For one particular MOF, UMCM-150, we show that separate parameters need to be used for the Cu-Trimer unit, for which the interaction energies with ethylene are much lower than those in the Cu-paddlewheel. Overall, our approach demonstrates that the specific CUS interactions in MOFs can be parametrized separately from other interaction types, such as van der Waals, thus opening the way for the development of an accurate and fully transferable force field for this class of materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-containing MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UMCM-150\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-Trimer unit\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The modification was done by grafting ethylenediamine and aminomethanesulfonic acid onto coordinatively unsaturated sites of the MOF, MIL-100(Cr). The adsorptive removal of a basic quinoline or benzothiophene can be improved noticeably, especially at low concentrations, with the introduction of an acidic site; however, a basic MOF causes a severe decrease in the adsorptive performance for a basic adsorbate such as quinoline. The effect of the interaction of the base\u2013base on adsorption was more severe or detrimental for a hard base quinoline than for a soft base benzothiophene. Functionalized MOFs show a slightly decreased adsorption for a neutral adsorbate such as indole probably because of the decreased porosity of the MOFs compared with the virgin MOF without functionalization. Moreover, a functionalized MOF (with SO3H group) can be used several times after simple washing with acetone. From the present research, it may be concluded that acid\u2013base interactions between NCCs and MOFs will lead to favorable adsorptive removal of NCCs.

The sensing principle of the sensor is based on the change in the dielectric properties of the bed, in response to CO2 concentration change in the dry CO2/He mixture. The sensor\u2019s response is quantified in terms of change in the resonant frequency with respect to baseline for each material.

The sensitivity of the microwave senor to CO2 concentration, with MOF-199-M2 as the bed is higher than MOF-199-M1, which can be related to the presence of different amount of unsaturated Cu2+ ions in their frameworks.

Herein, a novel metal organic framework (ZIF-8)-derived nitrogen doped carbon (ZIF-NC) modified g-C3N4 heterostructured composite was synthesized through a facile thermal treatment method. Benefiting from the hierarchical porosity, conductive network, and abundant exposed active sites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of MOF-derived nitrogen doped carbon, the introduction of MOF-derived nitrogen doped carbon into g-C3N4 not only facilitates the charge separation of g-C3N4 but also greatly accelerates PMS activation to yield high active SO4\u2212 radical. The energy band diagrams derived from Mott-Schottky, valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicate that the formed heterojunction between g-C3N4 and ZIF-NC is Schottky type. The ZIF-NC with lower Fermi level energy can serve as an excellent electron accepter to enable fast electron transfer from the conduction band of g-C3N4 to ZIF-NC and boost the charge separation of g-C3N4.

Microporous MOF materials, due to their high permeability and size selectivity, have attracted tremendous interest in gas storage and separation, large molecule adsorption, catalysis, and sensing. Despite the significant fabrication challenges, nanosized MOF particles can be fabricated to display enhanced gas storage and separation abilities in comparison to the parent MOF bulk counterparts under special synthesis conditions. So far, the majority of MOF nanocrystals have been derived from the controlled nucleation and growth of molecular precursors in homogeneous solutions. However, synthesis protocols based on nucleation and growth from dilute solution precursors are difficult to adapt to the synthesis of other nanoscopic materials, such as thin film and mixed-matrix membranes, which limits the practical applications of MOFs.

The objective of this work is to determine material stability of MOF-5 membranes during pervaporation of organic solvents. High quality MOF-5 membranes about 10\u03bcm in thickness were prepared by the secondary growth method using ball-milled MOF-5 seed crystals. On-stream p-xylene pervaporation test of the as-synthesized MOF-5 membrane shows the p-xylene flux declines and levels off at a steady-state value about 70% of the original value for fresh-membrane after 16h on the stream. The p-xylene flux cannot be restored to the original value, suggesting permanent fouling of the MOF-5 membrane upon exposure to p-xylene stream. Subsequent characterization indicated there was no structural or microstructural degradation that occurred, and evidence of retained xylene isomers in the MOF-5 structure was found using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the fouled MOF-5 membranes exhibit stable pervaporation fluxes for organic molecules with sizes smaller than the aperture of the MOF-5 cage, and exclude organic molecules with sizes larger than MOF-5 aperture. The results show that the MOF-5 membranes, after a permanent reduction in permeation flux by initial exposure to xylene stream, are stable in organic solvent and can be used for separation of liquid organic molecules based on the molecular sieving effects.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of large molecules\", \"pervaporation\", \"separation of liquid organic molecules\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Abstract: Photocatalysis is one of the best solutions to solve the problems of global energy shortage and environmental deterioration since it can utilize the abundant and ubiquitous solar light for chemical transformations. In addition to traditional semiconductor-based photocatalysts, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of micro\u2013mesoporous hybrid materials, are recently emerging as a new type of photocatalytic materials due to their unique structural characteristics. Among all the MOFs, Fe-containing MOFs are extremely appealing in photocatalysis since most of the Fe-based MOFs are visible light responsive due to the existence of extensive iron\u2013oxo (Fe\u2013O) clusters. In addition, Fe is an earth-abundant metal and Fe-containing complexes are commonly used in catalysis and photocatalysis. In this short review, we summarized the recent progress in using Fe-based MOFs for several photocatalytic applications, including pollutants degradation, water oxidation/reduction, CO2 reduction and organic transformations, with a focus on their different light-harvesting properties as compared with that of Ti- and Zr-containing MOFs as well as the structural influence on photocatalysis due to the existence of the diversified Fe-based MOFs.

On account of the good dispersion of drug-loaded CD-MOF nanocrystals inside polyacrylic acid (PAA) matrices and the homogeneous distribution of the drug molecules within these crystals, the composite microspheres exhibit not only spherical shapes and sustained drug release over a prolonged period of time, but they also demonstrate reduced cell toxicity.

{"prompt": "Fabrication of an MOF-derived heteroatom-doped Co/CoO/carbon hybrid with superior sodium storage performance for sodium-ion batteries\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained significant attention as precursors for the fabrication of porous hybrid materials due to their highly controllable composition, structure and pore size. However, at present, MOF-derived materials have rarely been investigated as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In this work, we report the fabrication of a Ni-doped Co/CoO/N-doped carbon (NC) hybrid using bimetallic Ni\u2013Co-ZIF as the starting precursor. The resulting Ni-doped Co/CoO/NC hybrid is highly microporous with a high specific surface area of 552 m2 g\u22121. When employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, the Ni-doped Co/CoO/NC hybrid exhibited both good rate performance with a high discharge capacity of 218 mA h g\u22121 at a high current density of 500 mA g\u22121 and good cycling stability, as a high discharge capacity of 218.7 mA h g\u22121 can be retained after 100 cycles at 500 mA g\u22121, corresponding to a high capacity retention of 87.5%. The excellent electrochemical performance of the Ni-doped Co/CoO/NC hybrid for SIBs may be attributed to the synergistic effects of various factors, including: (i) the presence of a carbon matrix which provides protection against aggregation and pulverization during sodiation/desodiation; (ii) the highly microporous nature along with the presence of a few mesopores which facilitates better insertion/de-insertion of Na+ ions; (iii) the Ni-doping which introduces defect sites into the atomic structure of CoO via partial substitution, thus enhancing the conductivity of the cobalt oxide (CoO) component and hence, the overall hybrid material, and (iv) the N-doping which promotes a faster migration speed of sodium ions (Na+) across the carbon layer by creating defect sites, thereby improving the conductivity of the carbon frameworks in the hybrid material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"ZnL(DPE)(H2O)\\\\u00b7H2O (DPE=(E)-1, 2-di(pyridine \\\\u2032-4-yl)ethene)\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocurrent responses\", \"photocurrent\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"CdL(H2O)2\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocurrent responses\", \"photocurrent\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"CdL\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocurrent responses\", \"photocurrent\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The two carboxylate groups present in the NDC ligand promote various coordination modes, which prompt diverse MOF structures with good porosity. The coordination of NDC ligands with metal ions, mostly Zn(II), Cd(II), Mn(II), Co(II), Ag(I) and lanthanides have created MOFs with different networks and topologies, with innovative applications in the fields of gas storage, gas separation, luminescence, catalysis, drug delivery and magnetism. The choice of precursors, the reaction environment including temperature, metal/ligand ratio, solvent, pH, can profoundly affect the architecture of MOFs and quantitatively influence their probable applications.

It is found that water molecules in the pores of a flexible model of [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] exhibit slower dynamics than when the framework is artificially held rigid in the simulations. In contrast, the water dynamics in Co-MOF-74 is predicted to be accelerated by the framework vibrations. The origin of this different behavior directly relates to how water interacts with the two frameworks, which, in turn, determines different hydrogen-bond patterns in the pores. While the first water molecules adsorbed in [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] donate a single hydrogen bond to the Zn\u2013Cl groups and point the other hydrogen atom towards the center of the pore, water molecules adsorbed in Co-MOF-74 initially bind to the cobalt atoms of the framework via their oxygen atoms, thus leaving each molecule free to form two hydrogen bonds with additional molecules adsorbed at higher loading.

{"prompt": "Accurate Ab initio-based force field for predictive CO 2 uptake simulations in MOFs and ZIFs: Development and applications for MTV-MOFs\nFor a reliable prediction of CO 2 loading in metal-organic (MOFs) and zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) by molecular simulation, accurate description of the van der Waals (vdW) and Coulomb interactions is undoubtedly the most critical component. However, there have been some strong recent indications that the use of generic force fields (FFs) widely used in most current CO 2/MOF simulations that were not particularly parametrized for CO 2/MOF and ZIF systems could lead to serious discrepancies compared to experimental results. Here, we develop accurate vdW FFs for CO 2 uptake simulations in MOFs and ZIFs using high-level ab initio calculations, and validate the method by comparing the simulated and experimental CO 2 uptakes for various known MOFs and ZIFs. The agreements between simulations and experiments are shown to be excellent for several known MOFs and ZIFs, although the FF parameters are not specifically fitted to those particular systems, showing the potential transferability of the FF. Atomic charges of the adsorbents are computed via the rapid charge equilibration method. Using these highly accurate FFs, we reveal the origin of the enhanced CO 2 uptake in recently reported MOFs having multivariate functional groups (MTV-MOFs). We find that the capacity enhancement in MTV-MOFs arises from an increase in both vdW (due to tighter geometry) and electrostatic (due to increased dipole moment) interactions between CO 2 and MTV-MOF. We further predict that MOF-5-NO 2 can have an even higher CO 2 uptake than these MTV-MOFs due to a larger local dipole moment of the NO 2-functionalized linker than those found in the reported MTV-MOFs. As a further designing of the high capacity material, we then introduced both electron-donating and -withdrawing functional groups simultaneously in the same organic linker to increase the local dipole moment of the linker significantly. The resulting CO 2 uptake indeed increases substantially due to the favorable electrostatic interactions that can be tested experimentally. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5-NO2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO 2 uptake\", \"CO 2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MTV-MOFs\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO 2 uptake\", \"CO 2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO 2 uptake\", \"CO 2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO 2 uptake\", \"CO 2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-3\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO 2 uptake\", \"CO 2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-4\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO 2 uptake\", \"CO 2 capture\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Enhanced permeation arising from dual transport pathways in hybrid polymer\u2013MOF membranes\nThe rise of anthropogenic global warming has sparked new interest in developing strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Conventional carbon capture processes are not economically viable at scale due to their enormous energy cost. Membrane-based separation is a promising alternative, but its separation performance has traditionally been limited by a well-known trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Here, we report a hybrid polymer/inorganic membrane with dual transport pathways, which allows us to overcome this traditional limitation. The inorganic phase consists of a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), which is an ideal inorganic dispersant to construct dual transport pathways as the crystalline porous structure of MOFs is more amenable to molecular diffusion than polymers. Previous hybrid membrane research has failed to achieve sufficiently high loadings to establish a percolative network necessary for dual transport, often due to mechanical failure of the membrane at high loading. Using polysulfone and UiO-66-NH2 MOF as a model system, we achieve high MOF loadings (50 wt%) and observe the evolution from single mode to dual transport regimes. The newly formed percolative pathway through the MOF, which has not previously been observed, acts as a molecular highway for gases. As the MOF loading increases to 30 wt%, CO2 permeability increases linearly from 5.6 barrers in polysulfone homopolymer to 18 barrers. Crucially, between 30 and 40 wt%, a percolative MOF network arises and the CO2 permeability dramatically rises from 18 to 46 barrers; an eight-fold increase over pure polysulfone, while maintaining selectivity over methane and nitrogen near the pure polymer at 24 and 26, respectively. A similar phenomenon is observed in the measurement of the diffusion coefficient and is consistent with the formation of dual transport pathways. The findings in this study enable new approaches towards designing hybrid membranes with dual transport pathways. This is an important step towards a competitive membrane-based carbon capture process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks for highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\n\u00a9 2015 American Chemical Society. We report here the synthesis of a series of robust and porous bipyridyl- and phenanthryl-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO topology (BPV-MOF, mBPV-MOF, and mPT-MOF) and their postsynthetic metalation to afford highly active single-site solid catalysts. While BPV-MOF was constructed from only bipyridyl-functionalized dicarboxylate linker, both mBPV- and mPT-MOF were built with a mixture of bipyridyl- or phenanthryl-functionalized and unfunctionalized dicarboxylate linkers. The postsynthetic metalation of these MOFs with [Ir(COD)(OMe)]2 provided Ir-functionalized MOFs (BPV-MOF-Ir, mBPV-MOF-Ir, and mPT-MOF-Ir), which are highly active catalysts for tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes followed by dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ethers as well as C-H borylation of arenes using B2pin2. Both mBPV-MOF-Ir and mPT-MOF-Ir catalysts displayed superior activities compared to BPV-MOF-Ir due to the presence of larger open channels in the mixed-linker MOFs. Impressively, mBPV-MOF-Ir exhibited high TONs of up to 17000 for C-H borylation reactions and was recycled more than 15 times. The mPT-MOF-Ir system is also active in catalyzing tandem dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines to azasilolanes in the absence of a hydrogen acceptor. Importantly, MOF-Ir catalysts are significantly more active (up to 95 times) and stable than their homogeneous counterparts for all three reactions, strongly supporting the beneficial effects of active site isolation within MOFs.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically poor electrical conductors, which limits their uses in sensors, fuel cells, batteries, and other applications that require electrically conductive, high surface area materials. Although metal nanoclusters (NCs) are often added to MOFs, the electrical properties of these hybrid materials have not yet been explored. Here, we show that adding NCs to a MOF not only imparts moderate electrical conductivity to an otherwise insulating material but also renders it photoconductive, with conductivity increasing by up to 4 orders of magnitude upon light irradiation. Because charge transport occurs via tunneling between spatially separated NCs that occupy a small percent of the MOF's volume, the pores remain largely open and accessible. While these phenomena are more pronounced in single-MOF crystals (here, Rb-CD-MOFs), they are also observed in films of smaller MOF crystallites (MIL-53).

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of materials exhibiting high surface areas, controlled pore sizes, open metal sites and organic linkers. Utilizing MOFs as direct electrode materials for electrochemical sensing can offer inherent advantages such as containing a sensing element and a redox mediator in a single molecule; however, the direct use of MOFs as electrode materials is hindered because of their insulating nature and less stability in an aqueous medium. In this study, a new water stable Zn-MOF was synthesized and used directly as an electrode material. The Zn-MOF possesses good ability to electrocatalyze the hydrazine oxidation reaction. The Zn-MOF's inherent poor conductivity was overcome by including a hydrophobic electrolyte, tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate tetradodecylammonium salt (ETH 500), during the fabrication of the Zn-MOF membrane. After coating a thin film of the nafion-ETH500 supported Zn-MOF over a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the response for hydrazine oxidation was substantially improved. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) demonstrated a wide linear range from 20 to 350 \u03bcM (R2 = 0.9922) for hydrazine. A detection limit of 2 \u03bcM (n = 3) was observed.

{"prompt": "Stability of MOF-5 in a hydrogen gas environment containing fueling station impurities\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous, crystalline materials with potential application as hydrogen storage media in fuel cell vehicles. Unlike lower capacity adsorbents such as zeolites and carbons, some MOFs are expected to degrade due to attack by impurities present in the hydrogen fuel stream. Hydrogen intended for use in fuel cell vehicles should satisfy purity standards, such as those outlined in SAE J2719. This standard limits the concentration of certain species in the fuel stream based primarily on their deleterious effects on PEM fuel cells. However, the impact of these contaminants on MOFs is mostly unknown. In the present study MOF-5 is adopted as a prototypical moisture-sensitive hydrogen storage material. Five \u201cimpure\u201d gas mixtures were prepared by introducing low-to-moderate levels (i.e., up to \u223c200 times greater than the J2719 limit) of selected contaminants (NH3, H2S, HCl, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, N2, and He) to pure hydrogen gas. Subsequently, MOF-5 was exposed to these mixtures over hundreds of adsorption/desorption pressure-swing cycles and for extended periods of static exposure. The impact of exposure was assessed by periodically measuring the hydrogen storage capacity of an exposed sample. Hydrogen chloride was observed to be the only impurity that yielded a measurable, albeit small, decrease in hydrogen capacity; no change in H2 uptake was observed for the other impurities. Post-cycling and post-storage MOF-5 samples were also analyzed using infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction.

One of the key challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value). This study shows that after 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption. In contrast, comparing non-catenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Previous studies of water adsorption in MOFs have mainly relied on isotherm measurements that provide useful parameters such as adsorption uptake and isosteric heat of adsorption. The structural stability of MOFs in water vapor was also evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD).

Clearly the computational results depend on the interactions between the adsorbed species and the adsorbent, which are commonly described using force fields.

These strategies are classified as either (i) the imposition of photoresponsivity by a photoresponsive guest; (ii) post-synthetic modification (PSM) of frameworks to add in photoresponsive groups; (iii) synthesis of MOFs with linkers that support pendant photoresponsive groups; and, perhaps the most challenging, (iv) synthesis of MOFs from linkers that themselves have intrinsic structural photoresponsivity such that their structure is altered on illumination. Examples are given of each approach, future applications are proposed, and strategic pathways to next-generation photoresponsive frameworks are discussed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"H2\"], \"applications\": [\"gas storage\", \"separation\", \"photoresponsive\", \"photoresponsive frameworks\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Two tandem reactions, including an additional cyclization step, leads to the effective production of indoles and imidazopyridines. In particular, the lamellar compound [Cu(BDC)] (BDC=benzene dicarboxylate) is highly efficient for the preparation of imidazopyridines, although a progressive structural change of the solid to a catalytically inactive compact structure is produced, causing deactivation of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the phase change can be reverted by refluxing in DMF, which recovers the original lamellar structure and the catalytic activity of the fresh material. The use of [Cu(BDC)] for this reaction also prevents the formation of Glaser/Hay condensation products of the alkyne, even when the reaction is performed in air atmosphere.

In this study, an effective strategy was developed to improve the conductivity of MOFs by partially substituting Ni2+ in the Ni-MOF with Co2+ or Zn2+. The mixed-metal organic frameworks (M-MOFs) showed excellent electrochemical performance, which is attributed not only to the favorable paths for charge transport due to the presence of free pores, but also to the raised electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) at the enlarged specific surface area of the material. Meanwhile, the cycling stability of the assembled hybrid supercapacitors (M-MOFs//CNTs\u2013COOH) is enhanced due to the alleviation of phase transformation during electrochemical cycling tests.

{"prompt": "Theoretical study on adsorption properties of methyl methacrylate and its molecular chain within metal-organic frameworks\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. Utilizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a \u201cpolymerization container\u201d is a very effective method to prepare oriented and therefore birefringent polymer materials. In particular, the adsorption of polymer monomers and molecular chains within MOFs has a profound impact on the orientation of polymer chains. In this work, a theoretical study on the adsorption properties of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and its molecular chain within MOFs has been conducted by employing a combination of molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo method, where 2 MOFs, [Zn2(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)2triethylenediamine]n and [Zn2(4,4\u2032-biphenyldicarboxylate)2triethylenediamine]n, were chosen. The corresponding number and degree of orientation of adsorbed molecules in these 2 MOFs were obtained from the simulations. The calculation results revealed 3 factors that affect the adsorption and orientation of MMA monomers in MOF pore channels. First, as the walls of the MOF pores are polar surfaces and consist of metal ions and organic ligands, the electrostatic interaction between the MOF channels and polar MMA molecules promotes the adsorption and orientation of the MMA monomers within the pore channel.

Last, the relative sizes of the MOF pores and the monomers are also relevant. When the sizes of the MOF channels and monomers are similar, the molecular chains show a higher degree of orientation.

A highly porous metal-organic framework (MOF) incorporating two kinds of second building units (SBUs), i.e., dimeric paddlewheel (Zn 2 (COO) 4 ) and tetrameric (Zn 4 (O)(CO 2 ) 6 ), is successfully assembled by the reaction of a tricarboxylate ligand with Zn II ion. Subsequently, single-crystal-to-single-crystal metal cation exchange using the constructed MOF is investigated, and the results show that Cu II and Co II ions can selectively be introduced into the MOF without compromising the crystallinity of the pristine framework. This metal cation-exchangeable MOF provides a useful platform for studying the metal effect on both gas adsorption and catalytic activity of the resulted MOFs. While the gas adsorption experiments reveal that Cu II and Co II exchanged samples exhibit comparable CO 2 adsorption capability to the pristine Zn II -based MOF under the same conditions, catalytic investigations for the cycloaddition reaction of CO 2 with epoxides into related carbonates demonstrate that Zn II -based MOF affords the highest catalytic activity as compared with Cu II and Co II exchanged ones. Molecular dynamic simulations are carried out to further confirm the catalytic performance of these constructed MOFs on chemical fixation of CO 2 to carbonates. This research sheds light on how metal exchange can influence intrinsic properties of MOFs. A cation-exchangeable metal-organic framework (MOF) offers a useful platform for studying the metal effect on both CO 2 adsorption and catalytic fixation, which is demonstrated by catalytic CO 2 cycloaddition with propylene oxide to produce propylene carbonate and molecular simulations.

This review focuses on the fabrication of continuous, thin porous films, either supported on solid substrates or as free-standing membranes. The availability of such two-dimensional types of porous coatings opened the door for a number of new perspectives for functionalizing surfaces.

Even though numerous articles have been written emphasizing the adsorption properties of these MOFs, their compatibility with respect to the sensing device has not been explored. While there are numerous types of sensing devices that could benefit from the use of MOF-based coatings to enhance sensitivity and selectivity, we are particularly interested in microcantilevers because of the high sensitivity they can provide within a compact, lower-power architecture. In this paper, we address this need by analyzing the effect of the mechanical properties of MOFs on the sensor response. In particular, we are interested in the structural flexibility of MOFs, because this unique guest-induced property can be used for strain-induced sensing attribute of the microcantilever. In this regard we examined the effects of important MOF mechanical properties such as the Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density on the sensor response for a range of values representative of the MOFs available in the literature. From our analysis we determined that increasing the Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio improve the response, while the density of the MOF has a negligible effect on the cantilever response.

MMMs prepared by conventional methods, therefore, often suffer from defects at the polymer-filler interface. In this work, a novel filler having hydroxyl functional groups on the surface (Mg-MOF-74) was used as a filler and mixed with PIM-1 in solution (chloroform). Under optimized solution conditions (65\u00b0C and 24h), chemical crosslinking between the hydroxyl groups and the fluoride chain-ends of PIM-1 was facilitated, to completely remove these interfacial defects. The crosslinked MMMs were then characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and mechanical tests, while their separation properties were studied for five gases including H2, CO2, CH4, N2 and O2 upon increasing Mg-MOF-74 loading (0\u201320% wt.). The two main features of MOF-74 (also known as CPO-27), especially Mg-MOF-74, greatly contributing to the membrane gas separation were 1-D hexagonal channels (1.1nm diameter) and an exceptionally high CO2 adsorption capacity under reduced pressures.

Incorporation of MOFs resulted in increased density, Tg and improved degradation behavior of the membranes confirming a good compatibility between the polymer and the MOFs. Low pressure gas separation showed moderate enhancement in CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity of MOF-MMMs compared to native polymer membranes, but the improvement becomes pronounced at high pressures. At high pressures, the native Matrimid\u00ae-PI membrane showed typical plasticization behavior, while in MMMs, MOF particles limit the mobility of polymer chains thus suppressing CO2 induced plasticization and maintain large separation factors over a wide pressure range investigated. The respective increase in performance of MMMs is very much dependent on MOF crystal structure and its interactions with CO2 gas molecules. Among the three MOF-MMMs, membranes based on Cu3BTC2 showed highest selectivity while ZIF-8 based membranes showed highest permeability. In general it can be concluded that the high CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity of MMMs is the combined effect of an increased sorption and diffusion selectivity and reduced plasticization. Overall, this work reveals that MOF-MMMs delay CO2 induced plasticization and show good separation performance even at high pressures, showing their potential to a wide range of newly emerging high pressure energy applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-53(Al)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"breathing MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"flexible MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cu3BTC2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"rigid MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Kinetic stability of MOF-5 in humid environments: Impact of powder densification, humidity level, and exposure time\n\u00a9 2015 American Chemical Society. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of microporous, crystalline materials with potential applications in the capture, storage, and separation of gases. Of the many known MOFs, MOF-5 has attracted considerable attention because of its ability to store gaseous fuels at low pressure with high densities. Nevertheless, MOF-5 and several other MOFs exhibit limited stability upon exposure to reactive species such as water. The present study quantifies the impact of humid air exposure on the properties of MOF-5 as a function of exposure time, humidity level, and morphology (i.e., powders vs pellets). Properties examined include hydrogen storage capacity, surface area, and crystallinity. Water adsorption/desorption isotherms are measured using a gravimetric technique; the first uptake exhibits a type V isotherm with a sudden increase in uptake at \u223c50% relative humidity. For humidity levels below this threshold only minor degradation is observed for exposure times up to several hours, suggesting that MOF-5 is more stable than generally assumed under moderately humid conditions. In contrast, irreversible degradation occurs in a matter of minutes for exposures above the 50% threshold. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that molecular and/or dissociated water is inserted into the skeletal framework after long exposure times. Densification into pellets can slow the degradation of MOF-5 significantly, and may present a pathway to enhance the stability of some MOFs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"capture, storage, and separation of gases\", \"storage\", \"separation of gases\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "MOF-polymer enhanced compatibility: Post-annealed zeolite imidazolate framework membranes inside polyimide hollow fibers\n\u00a9 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Thermal annealing, a commonly used procedure for improving the performance of polymeric membranes, is in this work exploited in the presence of a metal-organic framework (MOF) supported layer. MOFs and polymers are materials with a common organic character, suggesting an enhanced affinity between them when used together in membrane separation. Zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) ZIF-8 and ZIF-93 with sod and rho structures and pore apertures of 0.34 and 0.36 nm, respectively, have been grown inside 356 \u03bcm OD co-polyimide P84 hollow fibers by microfluidics, leading to continuous supported membranes. When these membranes were thermally in situ annealed below the glass transition temperature, while monitoring both H2 and CH4 permeances, the MOF-polymer adhesion was enhanced. Thus the gas separation selectivity increased without any significant reduction in the gas permeance, and H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 maximum selectivities of 103 and 18 (ZIF-8) and 101 and 20 (ZIF-93) were respectively measured. The good compatibility between MOF and polymer made improvements possible in the annealing of the membrane once it was prepared. If the annealing of the polymer was carried out before the MOF synthesis, the polymer chain rearrangement and surface smoothing prevented an optimum MOF-polymer interaction and the separation performance worsened.

{"prompt": "Designing Heterogeneous Catalysts by Incorporating Enzyme-Like Functionalities into MOFs\nEveryone who works within the field of catalysis draws inspiration from the amazing functionality of nature\u2019s catalysts, the enzymes. It is particularly the mild conditions that these catalysts are able to operate at and the selectivity that they demonstrate that make these materials dream targets for scientists involved in the art of synthesizing homogeneous and heterogeneous industrial catalysts. But enzymes also have their weak points; in particular their low thermal stability and their often too slow reaction rates for an economical industrial process are problems that have to be overcome. The obvious solution would be to copy the catalytic active center into a robust open framework. A key property of an enzyme is its selectivity; this property is partly regulated by steric constraints surrounding the catalytically active site. The microporous zeolite based catalysts in some cases show impressive selectivity based on the geometrical constraints imposed by the size and shape of the regular channels in these crystalline silicate and alumino-phosphate based structures, and enzyme-like properties have been claimed but the pure inorganic nature of the selective internal surface in these materials makes it impossible to mimic many important enzymatic properties. The new generation of microporous materials, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are hybrids of organic and inorganic structures. This dualistic nature offers an unprecedented flexibility in the possibility to incorporate both organic and metallic functional groups into the ordered crystalline lattice and thereby opening up for a much greater possibility to copy structural motifs known from enzymes into much simpler but also more stable open structures. Several groups are working on development of new catalysts by this approach.

{"prompt": "Screening of Copper Open Metal Site MOFs for Olefin/Paraffin Separations Using DFT-Derived Force Fields\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Efficient processes for adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures are likely to have many advantages over traditional separation techniques for these commodity chemicals. Although some metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied experimentally for this process, a large-scale computational screening study has not been reported due to the inherent difficulty in describing the critical role of interactions of olefins with open metal sites (OMS). In this paper, we introduce new density functional theory (DFT) derived force fields (FFs) that accurately describe adsorption of C2 and C3 olefins and paraffins in CuBTC. Using detailed DFT calculations for MOF-505 and PCN-16, we show that the energetics predicted by our FFs are transferable to other related MOFs that contain Cu OMS. Next, we evaluate the performance of 94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties as adsorbents. Finally, we show that the ideal adsorbed solution theory is inaccurate for inhomogeneous olefin/MOF systems and present extensive binary propane/propylene adsorption isotherms for the top-performing MOFs identified in our calculations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-505\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures\", \"adsorptive separation\", \"olefin/paraffin separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"PCN-16\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures\", \"adsorptive separation\", \"olefin/paraffin separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CuBTC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures\", \"adsorptive separation\", \"olefin/paraffin separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

This reaction can be applied to a wide range of substrates with medium to high yield. Controlled experiments and ESR results revealed a superoxide radical ( O 2 - )-mediated pathway, which is derived from the reduction of O2 by photogenerated Fe2+ on Fe\u2013O clusters. The whole multistep reaction is limited by the step of the photo-oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes.

{"prompt": "MOF-mixed matrix membranes: Precise dispersion of MOF particles with better compatibility via a particle fusion approach for enhanced gas separation properties\nMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporating conventional fillers frequently suffer from insufficient adhesion between the polymer matrix and the fillers. This often results in the formation of non-selective voids at the filler/polymer interface, which decreases the performance of the membrane. A novel approach is presented here to develop metal organic framework (MOF) based MMMs by using the self-assembly of MOF and polymer particles followed by their controlled fusion. MOF-polymer interaction is optimized through this strategy and it overcomes MOF-polymer incompatibility, MOF agglomeration and MOF distribution problems, happening especially at high loadings of MOFs when applying conventional methods. Matrimid\u00ae polymer particles were first prepared by precipitating a Matrimid\u00ae polymer solution in water. The surface of these particles was then modified by the introduction of imidazole groups, enhancing the chemical compatibility with the selected ZIF-8 MOF. ZIF-8 nanoparticles were then grown in-situ to this modified polymer particle suspension by addition of the precursor for ZIF-8 synthesis. The resulted suspension was cast to dryness and annealed in a solvent\u2013vapor environment to induce particle fusion, leading to a dense MMM structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed an excellent dispersion of the ZIF-8 nanoparticles forming a percolating pathway without any agglomeration, even at 40wt% loading of the ZIF-8. Excellent dispersion of ZIF-8 and an excellent ZIF-8-polymer interfacial adhesion resulted in a significant improvement in both CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity. The CO2 permeability of the MMMs increased by 200% and the CO2/CH4 selectivity increased by 65% as compared to unfilled Matrimid\u00ae. More detailed analysis of the gas transport performance of the MMMs showed that the CO2 permeability and the CO2/CH4 selectivity are mainly governed by the increase in CO2 diffusivity. The presented approach is a very versatile MMM preparation route, not only for this specific ZIF and polymer but for a wide range of material combinations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation properties\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Matrimid\\u00b7\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation properties\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "CD-MOF: A Versatile Separation Medium\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied in the context of a wide variety of applications, particularly in relation to molecular storage and separation sciences. Recently, we reported a green, renewable framework material composed of \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) and alkali metal salts - namely, CD-MOF. This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry. Here, we report the ability of CD-MOF to separate a wide variety of mixtures, including ethylbenzene from styrene, haloaromatics, terpinenes, pinenes and other chiral compounds. CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol.

{"prompt": "Rapid microwave-hydrothermal conversion of lignin model compounds to value-added products via catalytic oxidation using metal organic frameworks\nMicrowave irradiation is an effective method for faster heating to shorten reaction time of oxidative valorization of lignin. However, studies using microwave irradiation for lignin oxidation all employ homogeneous catalysis. Thus, this study aims to investigate heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of lignin under microwave irradiation. Especially, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are adopted as transition metal-containing heterogeneous catalysts for lignin oxidation. In particularly, MOFs (MIL-101 (Cr), MIL-101 (Fe), UiO-66, HKUST-1, and MOF-801) are also prepared using microwave irradiation and used as for oxidative conversion of a model lignin compound, vanillyl alcohol (VAL), to the valuable products, vanillin (VN) and vanillic acid (VAC), using H2O2 as an oxidant. While the tested MOFs all exhibit catalytic activities for VAL conversion to VN/VAC, MIL-101 and MOF-801 appear to be relatively effective. Through investigating the effect of temperature, VAL conversion to VN/VAC is less favorable at higher temperature possibly due to degradation of H2O2 at high temperatures. While a higher dosage of H2O2 increases VAL conversion, the additionally added H2O2 seems to further oxidize VN to VAC instead of converting more VAL to VN. Through the EPR analyses, the mechanism of VAL conversion to VN/VAC may be attributed to both the OH-based and non-OH\u2022 routes. The most effective MOF, MOF-801, also exhibited very similar catalytic activities over several cycles. The results indicate that MOFs can convert VAL to valuable products of VN and VAC within a very short time (10\u00a0min) under microwave irradiation.

{"prompt": "Adsorption study of CO2, CH4, N2, and H2O on an interwoven copper carboxylate metal\u2013organic framework (MOF-14)\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are attractive microporous materials for adsorption separations due to their extraordinary structures and impressive high surface areas. Catenation, or framework interpenetration, can significantly impact the crystal stability and improve the adsorption interactions. This interesting approach was used to obtain {[Cu3(BTB)2(H2O)3]\u22c5(DMF)9(H2O)2} (MOF-14) as a microporous material with a high surface area and large pore volume, which are desirable parameters for adsorption applications. Here, we report a detailed study of this catenated material with its gas adsorption properties. The potential for adsorption separations is evaluated by measuring pure-component adsorption isotherms for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen. The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) was used to evaluate adsorption selectivities of MOF-14 for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 equimolar mixtures. In addition, water adsorption and the impact of exposure on structural degradation are reported. Compared to other open-metal site MOFs, MOF-14 adsorbs significantly less water. This interwoven MOF is a promising competitor to other MOF materials in the gas separation field due to low interactions with water and high selectivity for CO2 over N2.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-14\", \"mof_formula\": \"[Cu3(BTB)2(H2O)3]\\u00b7(DMF)9(H2O)2\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2\", \"H2O\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"separations\", \"gas separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Systematic modulation and enhancement of CO2\u2006:\u2006N2 selectivity and water stability in an isoreticular series of bio-MOF-11 analogues\nAn isoreticular series of cobalt-adeninate bio-MOFs (bio-MOFs-11\u201314) is reported. The pores of bio-MOFs-11\u201314 are decorated with acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate, respectively. The nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption properties of these materials are studied and compared. The isosteric heats of adsorption for CO2 are calculated, and the CO2\u2006:\u2006N2 selectivities for each material are determined. As the lengths of the aliphatic chains decorating the pores in bio-MOFs-11\u201314 increase, the BET surface areas decrease from 1148 m2 g\u22121 to 17 m2 g\u22121 while the CO2\u2006:\u2006N2 selectivities predicted from ideal adsorbed solution theory at 1 bar and 273 K for a 10\u2006:\u200690 CO2\u2006:\u2006N2 mixture range from 73\u2006:\u20061 for bio-MOF-11 to 123\u2006:\u20061 for bio-MOF-12 and finally to 107\u2006:\u20061 for bio-MOF-13. At 298 K, the selectivities are 43\u2006:\u20061 for bio-MOF-11, 52\u2006:\u20061 for bio-MOF-12, and 40\u2006:\u20061 for bio-MOF-13. Additionally, it is shown that bio-MOF-14 exhibits a unique molecular sieving property that allows it to adsorb CO2 but not N2 at 273 and 298 K. Finally, the water stability of bio-MOFs-11\u201314 increases with increasing aliphatic chain length. Bio-MOF-14 exhibits no loss of crystallinity or porosity after soaking in water for one month.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"bio-MOF-11\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cobalt-adeninate bio-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"CO2\\u2006:\\u2006N2 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"bio-MOF-12\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cobalt-adeninate bio-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"CO2\\u2006:\\u2006N2 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"bio-MOF-13\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cobalt-adeninate bio-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"CO2\\u2006:\\u2006N2 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"bio-MOF-14\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cobalt-adeninate bio-MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"CO2\\u2006:\\u2006N2 selectivity\", \"molecular sieving\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

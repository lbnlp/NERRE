{"prompt": "A review of physical properties of separators for valve-regulated lead/acid batteries\nThe microglass separator has been used from the conception of valve-regulated lead/acid (VRLA) technology. There is increasing recognition that the separator has a critical role in battery performance. Research is supporting the position that compression exerted by the separator has an important role in premature capacity loss. Some companies have suggested that the separator compression set/creep plays a critical role in the battery failure mechanism in float applications. ALABC studies have shown that designs with higher compression improve the cycle life of batteries. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are designing their separators around the end-application of the battery. The separator in a VRLA battery is not an inactive spacer/barrier, as in a flooded lead/acid cell. Instead, these separators function as a key element, the third electrode. This paper reviews aspects of the microglass separator used in VRLA batteries. Information is provided to make a better separator selection, since a 100% microglass media, or any recombinant battery separator mat (RBSM) for a VRLA battery has a critical role in assuring the performance of the battery.

The three-dimensional feature of the model permits incorporation of various asymmetric boundary conditions; thus, the effects of cell orientation and packaging on thermal behavior can be analyzed for a multiple-cell battery pack. Various modes of boundary heat transfer such as radiation, insulation, and natural and forced convections were also included in the model. Model predictions agreed well with the temperature distributions measured in nickel/iron batteries. Application of the thermal model to a closely packed 330 Ah module of five cells indicated that excessive temperature rise will occur upon discharge.

Subsequently, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the long-range order in Cu3Pd (L12) at parallel {002} and parallel {111} Cu3Pd\u2013MnO interfaces.

In contrast, for the non-polar parallel {002} interface viewed along \u3008100\u3009 no influence on the L12 order and APB structure, even close to the interface could be observed.

The electrical conductivity measurement shows semiconducting property above room temperature for both the phases. Breaking of slope in the temperature dependence of the conductivity brings evidence in support of the phase transition for orthorhombic Sr1.3La0.7MnIrO6. At low temperature, the compounds show ferromagnetic behavior.

{"prompt": "Facile functionalization of PDMS elastomer surfaces using thiol-ene click chemistry\nA variety of methods have been developed for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer surface functionalization, particularly for the improvement of hydrophilicity. However, in addition to difficulties in avoiding undesired physical changes to the modified surface, including surface cracking, \"hydrophobic recovery\" frequently leads hydrophilically modified surfaces to completely return over time to their hydrophobic nature, with accompanying loss of accessible functional groups. Thiol-ene chemistry provides a mild and robust technology for synthetic elaboration. We demonstrate the introduction of thiol groups onto the PDMS surface via base-catalyzed equilibration of MTS ((MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH). Thiols in the product elastomer were shown to be located primarily at the air interface using EDX, XPS, and fluorescence labeling initially, and after extended periods of time: total thiol concentrations at the surface and in the bulk were established by complementary chemical titrations with DTDP (4,4\u2032-dithiodipyridine) and iodine titrations in different solvents. The surface density of thiols was readily controlled by reaction conditions: the rate of hydrophobic recovery, which led to incomplete loss of accessible functional groups, was determined. Thiol-ene click chemistry was then used to introduce a variety of hydrophilic moieties onto the surface including a silicone surfactant and maleic anhydride, respectively. In the latter case, molecular functionalization with both small (fluorescent labels) and polymeric nucleophiles (poly(ethylene glycol), chitosan) could be subsequently induced by simple ring-opening nucleophilic attack leading to permanently functional surfaces. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"polydimethylsiloxane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"PDMS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"elastomer\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"(MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"MTS\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"thiol-ene click chemistry\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"poly(ethylene glycol)\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"chitosan\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"elastomer\"], \"name\": \"polydimethylsiloxane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Segmental Anisotropy in Strained Elastomers Detected with a Portable NMR Scanner\nSingle-side NMR is particularly suitable for measurements of segmental anisotropy induced in elastomers by uniaxial forces or local strain.

This provided information on the dependence of the Hahn-echo decay on the angle between the direction of the uniaxial stretching force and the axis \u1e90 defined direction perpendicular to the magnet pole faces of the NMR-scanner. The anisotropy effect on the Hahn-echo decay is correlated with the extension ratio, and it is more evident in the liquid-like regime of the decay. A weaker segmental anisotropy is detected by 1H solid- and Hahn-echo decays recorded by multi-pulse sequences. A qualitative understanding of the angular dependence is obtained by an analytical theory of the Hahn-echo decay adapted to the case of stretched elastomers and to strongly inhomogeneous magnetic fields.

Lithium forms quasimetallic clusters in the nanopores of hard carbon whereas sodium does not. Recent developments in in situ7Li NMR research by some groups are also introduced. In situ NMR measurements of a LIB system can reveal the non-equilibrium state of the battery during charge and discharge.[TANSO 2014 (No. 263) 104\u20138.]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}
{"prompt": "Microstructural Effects on Electronic Charge Transfer in Li-Ion Battery Cathodes\nAn analytical model for the assessment of Li-ion battery cathode microstructure is presented. This model focuses on electronic transport within an extended surface of conductive material subject to charge transfer governed by linear surface charge transfer kinetics. In applying this approach the model presented allows for the prompt assessment of the impacts of microstructural morphology on electrode performance, thus providing for facilitated design of more deterministic electrode microstructures. It is demonstrated that the analytical approach developed can reproduce experimentally observed trends in measured electrode resistance and capture the effects of electrode microstructural morphology. The role of microstructural morphology is addressed for three common positive electrode chemistries: LiCoO2, LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4. For the first two of these electrode chemistries the impacts of both solid phase and surface morphology may be significant due to electronic transport losses dominating over charge transfer kinetics.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"Li-ion battery\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"LiCoO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"Li-ion battery\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"LiFePO4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"Li-ion battery\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"LiMn2O4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

{"prompt": "Entanglement in fermionic Fock space\nWe propose a generalization of the usual stochastic local operations and classical communications (SLOCC) and local unitary (LU) classifications of entangled pure state fermionic systems based on the spin group. Our generalization relies on the fact that there is a representation of this group acting on the fermionic Fock space, which, when restricted to fixed particle number subspaces, naturally recovers the usual SLOCC transformations. The new ingredient is the occurrence of Bogoliubov transformations of the whole Fock space, which change the particle number. The classification scheme built on the spin group naturally prohibits entanglement between states containing even and odd numbers of fermions. In our scheme the problem of the classification of entanglement types boils down to the classification of spinors where totally separable states are represented by so-called pure spinors. We construct the basic invariants of the spin group and show how some of the known SLOCC invariants are just their special cases. As an example we present the classification of fermionic systems with a Fock space based on six single particle states; an intriguing duality between two different possibilities for embedding three-qubit systems inside the fermionic ones is revealed. This duality is elucidated via an interesting connection to the configurations of wrapped membranes reinterpreted as qubits. \u00a9 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

We then extend the classical relation between designs and statistics to an application of the fuzzy spreads in statistics, by considering projective spaces as 2-designs.

{"prompt": "Kinetics of Catalytic Reactions on Nanoclusters\nKinetics of heterogeneous catalytic reactions on nanoclusters is considered. The size of organic molecules used in various catalytic transformations is often ca. 0.5-1 nm, whereas nanoparticles in the range 2-4 nm are used in supported heterogeneous catalysts. Proposed quantitative treatment of a heterogeneous catalytic mechanism with two kinetically significant steps assumes that a finite number of molecules per a single metal cluster can be adsorbed. A general equation with polynomial terms in the numerator and the denominator is derived for nonideal (nonuniform) surfaces when all kinetic and adsorption constants depend on the spatial arrangements of reacting molecules. A simplified case of a two-step catalytic cycle is discussed, with the first step being adsorption on nanoclusters and the second one being further transformation of absorbed species. The corresponding kinetic equations are derived and numerically analyzed for the case of ideal (uniform) surfaces as well as the presence of induced nonuniformity, when contrary to the ideal case there are lateral interactions between adsorbed species. The form of kinetic equations allows not only saturation, typical for Eley-Rideal kinetics, but also positive cooperativity, i.e., S-shaped behavior of the reaction rate as a function of substrate concentration.

Development of a breathing support with superior binding affinity for the facile immobilization of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) for remotely controlled chemical reactions is of immense scientific interest in catalytic applications. Herein, a straightforward and fast electrostatic self-assembly of Au NPs onto near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive plasmonic core-shell thermosensitive ionic microgels, which are based on gold nanorods (Au NRs) coated with microgel shells of ionic liquids, has been constructed. These self-assembled nanocomposites exhibit high catalytic activity and controllability as compared to other Au-based catalysts reported in literature for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. In the entire catalytic process, the NIR laser acts as a motor to drive the plasmonic core-shell ionic microgels for breathing and thereby tunes the progress of the catalytic reaction. Our results may provide a novel strategy, which is completely different from other traditional modes, to regulate the catalytic activity. The realization of this breathing modulation method induced by a remotely controlled way may create possibilities for the design of functional nanomaterials that can serve as intelligent catalysts with excellent catalytic activity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"Au NPs\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"reduction of 4-nitrophenol\"], \"name\": \"gold\", \"formula\": \"Au\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanorods\", \"nanoparticles\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"reduction of 4-nitrophenol\"], \"name\": \"gold\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanoparticles\", \"nanorods\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Au\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanorods\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"reduction of 4-nitrophenol\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Au\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanoparticles\"]}]"}

A new class of Na2MnSiO4/carbon/graphene (Na2MnSiO4/C/G) composite is successfully prepared and investigated for use as a cathode material for Na ion batteries. X-ray diffraction confirms that formation of a monoclinic structure with Pn space group. Morphological characterization shows that Na2MnSiO4 nanoparticles, about 30-40 nm in size with high density, are homogeneously anchored on the whole surface of the crumpled micrometer-size graphene nanosheets. The sodium insertion-extraction process of Na2MnSiO4 is similar to that of Li2MnSiO4 as a cathode in Li ion batteries. Compared with the Na2MnSiO4/C composite, the Na2MnSiO4/C/G composite shows much better electrochemical performance, including excellent rate performance and capacity retention.

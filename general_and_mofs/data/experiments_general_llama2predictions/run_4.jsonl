{"prompt": "Dynamic mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems in residential buildings\nBattery energy storage devices coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems have to react to the fluctuating nature of the PV output and electrical demand in residential buildings. However, the charging and discharging power cannot be adjusted to the power fluctuations without any time delay so that an inherent temporal mismatch between the battery power and the residual power (PV output minus load) occurs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a simulation study analyzing the response time-induced mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems. Firstly, the response time issue is analyzed theoretically to reveal how the energy flows between the household and the grid are changed due to the delayed battery response. Then, measurements are presented to show the dynamic behavior of two different PV-battery systems. The experimental results reveal settling times of up to 7 s to reach the steady state after an abrupt step change in the load demand. Thirdly, simulations of an AC-coupled PV-battery system are carried out with a time step size of 1 s. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the impact of the dynamic response on the annual amount of energy exchanged with the grid. It is found that longer response times are accomplished by an increase in the grid feed-in and grid supply as well. Consequently, a slow-reacting battery system diminishes the economic benefit for the owner of the PV-battery system. In order to improve the transparency from the end-custome\u0155s point of view, response time-related specifications should be stated in the data sheets of the products in the future.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

This article illuminates problems that can arise in the online estimation using recursive methods, and lists modifications to handle these issues.

{"prompt": "Coherent suppression of electromagnetic dissipation due to superconducting quasiparticles\nOwing to the low-loss propagation of electromagnetic signals in superconductors, Josephson junctions constitute ideal building blocks for quantum memories, amplifiers, detectors and high-speed processing units, operating over a wide band of microwave frequencies. Nevertheless, although transport in superconducting wires is perfectly lossless for direct current, transport of radio-frequency signals can be dissipative in the presence of quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap. Moreover, the exact mechanism of this dissipation in Josephson junctions has never been fully resolved experimentally. In particular, Josephson's key theoretical prediction that quasiparticle dissipation should vanish in transport through a junction when the phase difference across the junction is (ref. 2) has never been observed. This subtle effect can be understood as resulting from the destructive interference of two separate dissipative channels involving electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles. Here we report the experimental observation of this quantum coherent suppression of quasiparticle dissipation across a Josephson junction. As the average phase bias across the junction is swept through, we measure an increase of more than one order of magnitude in the energy relaxation time of a superconducting artificial atom. This striking suppression of dissipation, despite the presence of lossy quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap, provides a powerful tool for minimizing decoherence in quantum electronic systems and could be directly exploited in quantum information experiments with superconducting quantum bits. \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Because of their unique and universal properties, many researchers have focused on this field to find out what causes the serration behaviors and what can be learned about the material from the serration characteristics. For example, the serration characteristics contain information about the mechanisms of plastic deformation and the structural evolution during deformation.

With the Cu concentration decreasing, the microstructure was gradually dominated by columnar Mg when moving towards the substrate. Although microhardness values increased, room temperature dry sliding wear properties of the formed coating were adversely influenced by the Cu rejection due to the formation of the brittle CuMg2 phase.

{"prompt": "Solid-state contributions to densification during liquid-phase sintering\nDensification via liquid-phase sintering generally requires transport of substantial amounts of dissolved solid through the liquid. However, in composite systems, such as W-Cu, solid solubility in the liquid is almost negligible, and densification is hindered by the low amount of total mass transport. In this case, solid-state sintering of the skeletal solid structure in the presence of the liquid is a significant densification mechanism. In this article, the relative contributions to densification of both liquid and solid mass transport mechanisms are considered. A computer simulation is constructed to predict the densification behavior and concurrent microstructural development of liquidphase sintered composites for realistic heating cycles. Governing differential equations for densification are derived from idealized models of the microstructure, considering grain size, diffusion distance from vacancy source to sink, pore size, and pore morphology. Temperature-dependent terms, including the diffusivity, solubility, and surface energy, govern densification and microstructural parameters, such as the grain size, dihedral angle, and contiguity. Predictions for the sintered density, grain size, and contiguity are compared to experimental results for the W-Cu and W-Cu-Ni systems with approximately 20 vol pct liquid. For W-Cu, which has almost no intersolubility, solid-state sintering of W in the presence of liquid Cu is the dominant densification mechanism. Nickel additions increase solid solubility in the liquid and improve typical liquid-phase sintering contributions to densification. Alternatively, high sintered densities can be achieved in the absence of solubility with a sufficiently small particle size due to the solid-state contribution.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Cu\", \"description\": [\"composite system\", \"sintered\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Cu-Ni\", \"description\": [\"composite system\", \"sintered\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Cu\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"liquid\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"Cu\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Cu\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"Ni\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Cu-Ni\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Complete solid state deracemization by High Pressure Homogenization\nIn this work, we present High Pressure Homogenization as a novel approach to carry out attrition-enhanced deracemization, or Viedma Ripening. This is a process which leads to the conversion of a racemic or scalemic solid phase to an enantiomerically pure solid phase. The effect of pressure drop and homogenizer temperature on the evolution of deracemization of the compound N-(2-methylbenzylidene)-phenylglycine amide (NMPA) has been studied. Results prove the feasibility of the technique to achieve complete solid state deracemization, even without a substantial initial enantiomeric excess, and highlight low processing times. The effect of the homogenizer temperature has been demonstrated as a key parameter in HPH processing. These results establish the basis of High Pressure Homogenization as a new effective technique for Viedma ripening and open new possibilities for further development of solid state deracemization.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"N-(2-methylbenzylidene)-phenylglycine amide\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"NMPA\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name\": \"N-(2-methylbenzylidene)-phenylglycine amide\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"NMPA\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"deracemization\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Solid-phase extraction, separation and preconcentration of titanium(iv) with SSG-V10 from some other toxic cations: A molecular interpretation supported by DFT\nThe present work reports the separation and preconcentration of titanium(iv) with functionalized silica gel (SSG-V10). A density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been performed to analyze the structure of both the extractor and the titanium(iv)-extractor complex to rationalize the sorption pathway. The systematic studies on the solid phase extraction of titanium(iv) ensured its quantitative sorption at solution pH: 5.0-6.0, influent volume: 1000 mL, analyte concentration: 23.95-35.92 \u03bcg mL-1, flow rate: 2.5 mL min-1, temperature: 27 \u00b0C, time of equilibration: 1.5 minutes and stress of foreign ions concentration (Cl-, SO42-, ClO4- and NO3-): 200 \u03bcg mL-1. The extractor, i.e., SSG-V10 (29567.465 eV; \u03b7 = 3.671 eV), has a high BET surface area (149.46 m2 g-1), a good value of exchange capacity (2.54 meq. of H+ g-1 of dry SSG-V10), break-through capacity (Q0 = 37.4-40.7 \u03bcg mg -1) and column efficiency (N: 108) with respect to titanium(iv). The +ve \u0394H (0.048 kJ mol-1), \u0394S (5 J K-1 mol -1) and -ve \u0394G (-1.1488 kJ mol-1) indicate that the sorption process was endothermic, entropy-gaining and spontaneous in nature. The DFT calculations reveal that the guest, [(OH)(H2O)Ti(-\u03bcO) 2(OH)(H2O)]+2 (15531.185 eV; \u03b7 = 3.39 eV), is stabilized as a syn isomer. This syn isomer was then placed at the exchange site and a second DFT calculation was performed. It was found that the hydrogen bonded anti complex gets stabilized by 0.286 eV over the syn isomer as the extracted species. The loading of titanium(iv) has been confirmed by EDX. The sorbed titanium(iv) was eluted as a distinct and detectable color with 1 M HCl containing H2O2. The preconcentration factor has been optimized at 60.8 \u00b1 0.5. Titanium(iv) amid congeners and other metal ions, associated with it in ores and alloy samples, have been separated from synthetic mixtures.

{"prompt": "A stable, hydrogen-defect structure of post-perovskite (hy-ppv, Mg1\u2212x SiH2x O3) has been determined by first-principles calculations of the vibrational and elastic properties up to 150GPa. Among three potential hy-ppv structures analyzed, one was found to be stable at pressures relevant to the lower-mantle D\u2033 region. Hydrogen has a pronounced effect on the elastic properties of post-perovskite due to magnesium defects associated with hydration, including a reduction of the zero-pressure bulk (K 0) and shear (G 0) moduli by 5% and 8%, respectively, for a structure containing \u223c1wt.% H2O. However, with increasing pressure the moduli of hy-ppv increase significantly relative to ppv, resulting in a structure that is only 1% slower in bulk compressional velocity and 2.5% slower in shear-wave velocity than ppv at 120GPa. In contrast, the reduction of certain anisotropic elastic constants (Cij ) in hy-ppv increases with pressure (notably, C55, C66, and C23), indicating that hydration generally increases elastic anisotropy in hy-ppv at D\u2033 pressures. Calculated infrared absorption spectra show two O\u2013H stretching bands at \u223c3500cm\u22121 that shift with pressure to lower wavenumber by about 2cm\u22121/GPa. At 120GPa the hydrogen bonds in hy-ppv are still asymmetric. The stability of a hy-ppv structure containing 1\u20132wt.% H2O at D\u2033 pressures implies that post-perovskite may be a host for recycled or primordial hydrogen near the Earth\u2019s core-mantle boundary.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"hy-ppv,\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"post-perovskite\", \"formula\": \"Mg1\\u2212x SiH2x O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"hy-ppv\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"post-perovskite\", \"formula\": \"Mg1\\u2212x SiH2x O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"hydrogen-defect\"]}]"}

With the mass market penetration of electric vehicles, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with lithium-ion battery production has become a major concern. In this study, by establishing a life cycle assessment framework, GHG emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries in China are estimated. The results show that for the three types of most commonly used lithium-ion batteries, the (LFP) battery, the (NMC) battery and the (LMO) battery, the GHG emissions from the production of a 28 kWh battery are 3061 kgCO2-eq, 2912 kgCO2-eq and 2705 kgCO2-eq, respectively. This implies around a 30% increase in GHG emissions from vehicle production compared with conventional vehicles. The productions of cathode materials and wrought aluminum are the dominating contributors of GHG emissions, together accounting for around three quarters of total emissions. From the perspective of process energy use, around 40% of total emissions are associated with electricity use, for which the GHG emissions in China are over two times higher than the level in the United States. According to our analysis, it is recommended that great efforts are needed to reduce the GHG emissions from battery production in China, with improving the production of cathodes as the essential measure.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

Degraded battery modules waste more power, affecting the performance and economy for the whole battery pack. Also, such impact varies with different trip patterns. It is beneficial if the performance gain can be evaluated online prior to replacing certain battery module regarding to actual driving. In this paper, the research objectives are two-fold.

This study looked at the charge acceptance and maximum discharge ability of a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) and a Li-ion battery connected in parallel to supercapacitors. The test procedure evaluated the advantage of using a supercapacitor at a 2\u00a0F:1\u00a0Ah ratio with the battery types at various states of charge (SoC). The results showed that about 7% of extra charge was achieved over a 5-s test time for a Li-ion hybrid system at 20% SoC, whereas at the 80% SoC the additional capacity was approximately 16%. While for the VRLA battery hybrid system, an additional charge of up to 20% was achieved when the battery was at 80% SoC, with little or no benefit at the 20% SoC. The advantage of the supercapacitor in parallel with a VRLA battery was noticeable on its discharge ability, where significant extra capacity was achieved for short periods of time for a battery at the 60% and 40% SoC when compared to the Li-ion hybrid system. The study also made use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with a suitable equivalent circuit model to explain, in particular, the internal resistance and capacitance differences observed between the different battery chemistries with and without a supercapacitor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

At the respective quantum critical lines, two-dimensional superconductor-to-insulator (2D-QSI) transitions and three-dimensional superconductor-to-normal state (3D-QSN) transitions occur. The flow to these quantum critical points is tuned by doping, substitution and anisotropy. It is shown that the empirical correlations, like the dependence of Tc on dopant and substitution concentration, the dependence of Tc on zero temperature in-plane penetration depth, etc., reflect universal properties associated with the flow to these quantum critical points, and of the crossover from one to the other.

The model is developed in a formal thermodynamic setting, which provides guidance on admissible constitutive relationships and on the coupling of the numerous physical processes that are active. Phase changes are driven by temperature-dependent free-energy functions that become non-convex below a transition temperature. Higher-order spatial gradients are present in the model to account for phase boundary energy, and these terms necessitate the introduction of non-standard terms in the energy balance equation in order to satisfy the classical entropy inequality point-wise.

To deal rigorously with the presence of high-order spatial derivatives associated with surface energies at phase boundaries in both the momentum and mass balance equations, some novel numerical approaches are used. Numerical examples are presented that consider boundary cooling of a domain at different rates, and these results demonstrate that the model can qualitatively reproduce the evolution of microstructural features that are observed in some alloys, especially steels.

{"prompt": "Fatigue and fracture behavior of bulk metallic glasses and their composites\n\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd A fundamental understanding of the fatigue and fracture behavior of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) and their composites is of critical significance for designing new BMG systems and developing new manufacturing and processing techniques so as to broaden the scope of applications of BMGs and their composites. However, the fatigue and fracture studies on BMGs are limited so far, compared to other mechanical properties. The present work reviews the fatigue and fracture behavior of BMGs and their composites, as well as that of metallic-glass films, ribbons, and wires. The grand challenge for the fatigue and fracture performance of BMGs is: What produces a large difference among the fatigue and fracture results of BMGs? According to the fatigue and fracture investigations of crystalline alloys including recently invented high entropy alloys, many factors could be involved, such as the composition, material quality, specimen geometry, chemical environment, surface condition, temperature, cyclic frequency, mean stress, and residual stress, etc. Based on this challenge, the present work will review and address the factors affecting the fatigue and fracture behavior of BMGs and their composites. Furthermore, the mechanisms of fatigue-crack initiation, propagation, and fracture of BMGs and their composites in different loading conditions and environments will be outlined, analyzed, and discussed. Future research directions of fatigue and fracture of BMGs and their composites are provided for reference.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}
{"prompt": "A new family of cermets: Chemically complex but microstructurally simple\nCermets based on Ti(C,N) have interesting properties, such as high wear resistance, high chemical stability and good mechanical strength at high temperature, but to become a viable alternative to cemented carbides, the fracture toughness and damage tolerance must be significantly improved. Complete solid-solution cermets (CSCs) have been proposed to further improve the mechanical properties of these materials. However, to develop this family of cermets with a high level of quality and reliability, using pre-fabricated complex carbonitrides is necessary instead of unalloyed mixtures as the raw ceramic material. A mechanochemical process called mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) is suitable to obtain these complex carbonitrides with high stoichiometric control. On the other hand, high entropy alloys (HEAs), which can also be obtained by mechanochemical processes, are a good candidate to replace the current binder phase in cermets because they exhibit high strength and ductility at high temperature and good resistance to both wear and corrosion. In this work, a new family of CSCs based on (Ti,Ta,Nb)CxN1\u2212x with HEAs belonging to the Fe-Co-Ni-Cr-Mn-V system as the binder phase is developed by mechanochemical processes.

Herein, we demonstrate that a hybrid material composed of few-layer SnS 2 nanosheets sandwiched between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets exhibits a high specific capacity of 843 mAh g -1 (calculated based on the mass of SnS 2 only) at a current density of 0.1 A g -1 and a 98% capacity retention after 100 cycles when evaluated between 0.01 and 2.5 V. Employing ex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction techniques, we illustrate the high specific capacity of our anode through a 3-fold mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the ab-plane of SnS 2 nanosheets and the subsequent formation of Na 2 S 2 and Na 15 Sn 4 through conversion and alloy reactions. The existence of RGO nanosheets in the hybrid material functions as a flexible backbone and high-speed electronic pathways, guaranteeing that an appropriate resilient space buffers the anisotropic dilation of SnS 2 nanosheets along the ab-plane and c-axis for stable cycling performance.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnS2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"reduced graphene oxide\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"anode\", \"sodium-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnS2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"RGO\", \"applications\": [\"backbone\", \"electronic pathways\"], \"name\": \"reduced graphene oxide\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Na2S2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Na15Sn4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}

As a binder-free and flexible anode for SIBs, Bi2O3/C delivers a high reversible capacity of 430 mA h g\u22121 after 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g\u22121 and an exceptional rate capability of 230 mA h g\u22121 at 3200 mA g\u22121. It has a stable capacity of 252 mA h g\u22121 after 50 cycles at 400 mA g\u22121 in a Na-ion full cell device. The high capacity, good cyclability and rate capability are attributed to synergistic effects of the uniform distribution of ultra-small Bi2O3 nanoparticles (\u224810 nm) in the carbon nanofibers and the conducting framework of 3-D interconnected carbon nanofibers, which can effectively alleviate the volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation processes and maintain the high electrical conductivity throughout the electrode.

This model focuses on electronic transport within an extended surface of conductive material subject to charge transfer governed by linear surface charge transfer kinetics.

The role of microstructural morphology is addressed for three common positive electrode chemistries: LiCoO2, LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4.

From structural optimization based on total energy calculations, lattice and positional parameters have been established, which are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data except for I 21 3, where the symmetry analysis for optimized structure indicates that it arrived at the Ia 3\u0304 phase. In2 O3 of space group symmetry Ia 3\u0304 is found to undergo a pressure-induced phase transition to the R 3\u0304 phase at pressures around 3.8 GPa. From the analysis of band structure coming out from the calculations within the local density and generalized gradient approximations, it is found that In2 O3 of space group symmetry I 21 3 and R 3\u0304 are indirect band gap semiconductors, while the other phase of space group Ia 3\u0304 is having direct band gap.

The magnitudes of the absorption and reflection coefficients for In2 O3 with space groups Ia 3\u0304 and R 3\u0304 are small in the energy range 0-5 eV, indicating that these phases can be regarded and classified as transparent. \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"semiconductor\"], \"name\": \"indium oxide\", \"formula\": \"In2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"I 21 3\", \"Ia 3\\u00af\", \"R 3\\u00af\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"semiconductor\"], \"name\": \"indium oxide\", \"formula\": \"In2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"I213\", \"Ia3\\u00af\", \"R3\\u00af\"], \"description\": [\"polytypes\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Highly crystalline Prussian blue/graphene composites for high-rate performance cathodes in Na-ion batteries\n\u00a9 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry. We report the synthesis of highly crystalline Prussian Blue (PB) embedded in graphene oxide (GO) layers and its superior electrochemical properties. Highly crystalline PB is prepared from Fe2O3 nanoparticles anchored on GO (Fe2O3/GO). Regulated Fe3+-ion release and slow crystallization with [Fe(CN)6] in the vicinity of Fe2O3/GO produce a GO-interconnected PB (HC-PB/GO) with fewer [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and H2O molecules. When compared with PB synthesized under identical conditions without GO, the HC-PB/GO delivers a noticeably higher reversible capacity and better cyclability as a cathode in Na-ion batteries (SIBs). The improvement in high-rate performance is rather striking. While the energy density of PB at a charge/discharge (C/D) rate of 2.0 A g-1 is negligible, the HC-PB/GO delivers 280 mW h g-1. The increase of electronic conduction and Na+ ion diffusion in HC-PB/GO contribute to a substantial improvement in rate capability.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"PB\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"Na-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"Prussian Blue\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"highly crystalline\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"graphene oxide\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Fe2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanoparticles\", \"anchored on graphene oxide\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"Na-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"Prussian Blue\", \"formula\": \"Fe7(CN)18\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"embedded in graphene oxide layers\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"graphene oxide\", \"formula\": \"C\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"interconnected Prussian Blue\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"iron(III) oxide\", \"formula\": \"Fe2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanoparticles\"]}]"}

Seven extensively studied aspects regarding the applications of nanostructured ceria-based materials are selectively surveyed as well. New experimental approaches have been demonstrated with an atomic scale resolution characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide insight into the rational design of highly reactive catalysts and understanding of the interactions between the noble metal and ceria support.

{"prompt": "SOFC \u2013 A playground for solid state chemistry\nHigh processing and operation temperatures, as well as the presence of non-equilibrium phases turn solid oxide fuel cells into a playground for solid state reactivity. Formation of reaction products, diffusion, segregation, electronic structure modifications at electrolyte\u2013electrode interfaces and atsurfaces affect the oxygen exchange rates and impact the resulting SOFC performance. In the present work, various types of solid state reactivity in solid oxide fuel cells and particularly in systems with zirconia electrolyte and oxide cathodes are addressed. Examples of solid state reactivity induced modifications of bulk, interface and surface chemistry in the SOFC cathode are discussed and correlated with its electrochemical performance. The formation of pyrochlore is considered as example of solid state reactions that occur in zirconia\u2013manganite and zirconia\u2013cobaltite cathodes. Possible reaction mechanisms and their contributions are discussed for various perovskites and different geometries. The local interface chemistry and electronic structure in zirconia\u2013manganite cathodes are studied by ELNES. Differences between annealed and operated cathodes reveal that upon SOFC operation (cathode polarization) a highly defective structure with high concentrations of partially reduced transition metal develops at the interfaces. Based on the results, the impact of interface chemistry on cathode performance is evaluated. The influence of cathode and electrolyte surface chemistry on SOFC performance is illustrated in several examples that include electrochemical promotion, cathode poisoning by silicates and by chromium oxide. In situ spectro-microscopy is used to investigate the surface chemistry of operating model cathodes and electrolyte. The study reveals not only drastic differences between surface and bulk chemistry, it also shows that the cathode and electrolyte surface compositions change with cathode polarization. Oxygen incorporation in the SOFC cathodes with its different reaction steps is explored in terms of the local chemical environment of potential oxygen exchange sites and local conductivities. The concepts are then applied to explain the electrochemical performance of the cathodes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solid oxide fuel cells\", \"electrolyte\"], \"name\": \"zirconia\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solid oxide fuel cells\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"manganite\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"perovskite\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solid oxide fuel cells\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"cobaltite\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"perovskite\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solid oxide fuel cells\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"zirconia\", \"formula\": \"ZrO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"pyrochlore\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solid oxide fuel cells\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"manganite\", \"formula\": \"La0.6Sr0.4MnO3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"perovskite\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solid oxide fuel cells\", \"cathode\"], \"name\": \"cobaltite\", \"formula\": \"La0.6Sr0.4CoO3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"perovskite\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Dynamic mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems in residential buildings\nBattery energy storage devices coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems have to react to the fluctuating nature of the PV output and electrical demand in residential buildings. However, the charging and discharging power cannot be adjusted to the power fluctuations without any time delay so that an inherent temporal mismatch between the battery power and the residual power (PV output minus load) occurs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a simulation study analyzing the response time-induced mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems. Firstly, the response time issue is analyzed theoretically to reveal how the energy flows between the household and the grid are changed due to the delayed battery response. Then, measurements are presented to show the dynamic behavior of two different PV-battery systems. The experimental results reveal settling times of up to 7 s to reach the steady state after an abrupt step change in the load demand. Thirdly, simulations of an AC-coupled PV-battery system are carried out with a time step size of 1 s. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the impact of the dynamic response on the annual amount of energy exchanged with the grid. It is found that longer response times are accomplished by an increase in the grid feed-in and grid supply as well. Consequently, a slow-reacting battery system diminishes the economic benefit for the owner of the PV-battery system. In order to improve the transparency from the end-custome\u0155s point of view, response time-related specifications should be stated in the data sheets of the products in the future.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

This new approach combines traditional experimental testing with computer simulations to create a cost-effective means to evaluate EV batteries and provide important information that is difficult or impossible to obtain from purely experimental measurements. The present simulators for the lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries are developed based on the fundamental principles governing their electrochemical behaviors and are created using an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Computer simulations are validated by experimental data under the dynamic stress test (DST) procedure for a lead-acid battery module and a Ni-MH cell with good agreement. Moreover, computer simulations reveal that the studied lead-acid battery underutilizes the active material by as much as 70% and the MH electrode of the Ni-MH cell is overdesigned by about 30% under the simulated EV duty. Therefore, there is good potential of increasing the specific energy and reducing the cost if batteries are optimized for EVs using a simulation-based design approach. \u00a9 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

{"prompt": "Multi-objective optimization of demand response in a datacenter with lithium-ion battery storage\nThis article optimizes lithium-ion battery management in a datacenter to: (i) maximize the dollar savings attainable through peak shaving, while (ii) minimizing battery degradation. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, such multi-objective optimal datacenter battery management remains relatively unexplored. We solve this optimization problem using a second-order model of battery charge dynamics, coupled with a physics-based model of battery aging via solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Our optimization study focuses on a classical feedforward-feedback energy management policy, where feedforward control is used for peak shaving, and feedback is used for tracking a desired battery state of charge (SOC). Three feedforward-feedback architectures are examined: a proportional (P) control architecture, a proportional-integral (PI) architecture, and a PI architecture with a deadband in its feedforward path. We optimize these architectures\u2019 parameters using differential evolution, for real datacenter power demand histories. Our results show a significant Pareto tradeoff between dollar savings and battery longevity for all architectures. The introduction of a deadband furnishes a more attractive Pareto front by allowing the feedforward controller to focus on shaving larger peaks. Moreover, the use of integral control improves the robustness of the feedback policy to demand uncertainties and battery pack sizing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}

In this study, the worst scenarios on thermal runaway of four commercial batteries were conducted and compared. A customized-made closed testing instrument was utilized to measure and track thermal behaviors of four brands of cylindrical lithium-ion batteries under maximum open circuit voltage condition.

Plenty of nano-precipitates are able to be observed in the as-cast high-entropy alloy. The nano-precipitate belongs to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, while the matrix possesses a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure.

The plastic flow stress of Ni20Ti20Fe20Al20Cu20 high-entropy alloy at elevated temperatures is characterized by a steady state, which can be attributed to a competition between the increase of dislocation density due to plastic strain and the decrease of dislocation density due to dynamic recrystallization.

Reasons are manufacturing problems and limited durability in dynamic operation conditions due to deficient mechanical properties of the thermoelectric materials, which often suffer from low strength and high brittleness. We present a concept for the basically independent tailoring of mechanical and thermoelectric properties. This can be achieved by the alloying of TE materials with additional elements having preferably no or only little influence on the TE properties.

{"prompt": "Electronic origin of the high thermoelectric performance of GeTe among the p-type group IV monotellurides\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017. PbTe and SnTe in their p-type forms have long been considered high-performance thermoelectrics, and both of them largely rely on two valence bands (the first band at L point and the second one along the \u03a3 line) participating in the transport properties. This work focuses on the thermoelectric transport properties inherent to p-type GeTe, a member of the group IV monotellurides that is relatively less studied. Approximately 50 GeTe samples have been synthesized with different carrier concentrations spanning from 1 to 20 \u00d7 10 20 cm -3, enabling an insightful understanding of the electronic transport and a full carrier concentration optimization for the thermoelectric performance. When all of these three monotellurides (PbTe, SnTe and GeTe) are fully optimized in their p-type forms, GeTe shows the highest thermoelectric figure of merit (zT up to 1.8). This is due to its superior electronic performance, originating from the highly degenerated \u03a3 band at the band edge in the low-temperature rhombohedral phase and the smallest effective masses for both the L and \u03a3 bands in the high-temperature cubic phase. The high thermoelectric performance of GeTe that is induced by its unique electronic structure not only provides a reference substance for understanding existing research on GeTe but also opens new possibilities for the further improvement of the thermoelectric performance of this material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"GeTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"rhombohedral\", \"cubic\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"PbTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"GeTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"rhombohedral\", \"cubic\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"PbTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}]"}

In this paper, a methodology for the design of optimum hexagonal fuel assembly geometries was developed. For each nuclear reactor core made up of ducted assemblies there exists a unique optimum solution of duct wall thickness and inter-assembly gap, where these components have the minimum impact on the core neutron balance while adhering to applicable structural constraints. The assembly duct wall must maintain its structural integrity and intended function while being exposed to a harsh environment of pressure, temperature and neutron fluence causing elastic and inelastic deflections and swelling. Analytical expressions, applicable to any internally pressurized hexagonal structure, were defined for the peak stress and elastic wall deflection. Detailed analysis of fuel assembly duct designs requires finite element code analysis, radial bowing analysis codes and the full temperature, flux and stress distribution over the lifetime of the assembly in the core to accurately estimate creep deformation.

{"prompt": "Specific features of pulse and quasi-static remagnetization and relaxation properties of Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 single crystals\nThe hysteresis features in the behavior of the magnetization and resistance of Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 single crystals in quasi-static (up to 9 T) and pulsed (up to 14 T) magnetic fields have been studied. Relaxation processes of magnetization and resistance after the action of a magnetic field of 9 T have also been investigated.

Mechanism of the phase transitions antiferromagnetic insulator \u2194 ferromagnetic metal (AFM/I \u2194 FM/M) and existence of a high-conductive state of a sample after removal of magnetizing field in the temperature range below 150 K is proposed. The mechanism is determined by the structural transition, which is induced by a magnetic field (due to magnetostriction), and by a slow relaxation of the FM-phase (larger volume) to the stable AFM-phase (smaller volume) after field removal. It has been shown that, during pulse magnetization at the temperature 18 K, the time required for the AFM/I \u2192 FM/M phase transition is six\u2013seven orders of magnitude shorter than that for the FM/M \u2192 AFM/I phase transition.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"magnet\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"Imma\", \"p21/m\"], \"description\": [\"single crystals\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3\", \"description\": [\"single crystals\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]"}

The transition pressures to the \u03b2-Sn and sh phases for a non-vibrating crystal model are found to be 96 and 110 kbar respectively. These pressure values are considerably lower than the experimental values, but we show that lattice vibrations will increase the equilibrium-state pressures. We find widespread occurrence of instability in the equilibrium states of the three phases and show the presence of three kinds of instability. Near and up to the sh phase structure we find the unusual case of stability at constant volume, but, as observed, instability at constant pressure p. Two special computational procedures are discussed, which locate the unstable ranges of structure.

Tremendous research is performed globally to solve these problems associated with battery performance. One of the potential ways to improve battery electrochemical performance and safety is by developing hybrid lithium metal oxide based one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures by simple and advanced electrospinning processes. These electrospun nanostructures of continuous fibrous morphology are attractive as new cathode materials due to their shorter Li ion diffusion pathways, high surface area and porous network.

This condition is naturally associated with transformation groups of partially ordered sets and provides these groups with projective representations.

The consequences of this condition are studied in detail in application to two concrete space-times - four-dimensional Minkowski and three-dimensional de Sitter spaces - for which it is shown how this condition characterizes the states invariant under the respective isometry group. An intriguing new algebraic characterization of vacuum states is given.

The existence of infinitely many homogeneous geodesics on the compact semi-simple Lie group is established. We introduce the notion of a naturally reductive homogeneous Finsler space. As a special case, we study homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Randers spaces. Finally, we study some curvature properties of homogeneous geodesics.

{"prompt": "Topological and Nontopological Rearrangement in Crystal Lattice of Cholic Acid Inclusion Complex Induced by Guest Exchange\nThis article describes single-crystal to single-crystal transformations in the crystal lattice of the multimolecular inclusion complex of cholic acid (CA). These transformations are induced by the guest-exchange method, i.e., soaking the crystals of CA complex in liquid guest. In the present study, 2-, 3-, and 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol (2-, 3-, and 4-FBzOH, respectively) and water were used as guest molecules. The guest exchange from 2-to 4-FBzOH retained essentially both the amphiphilic bilayered structure and space group P21 of the starting complex. Similarly, the exchange from 3- to 4-FBzOH retained the bilayered structure and space group P21; in CA-3-FBzOH, the guest molecules in the channel are not related by 21 symmetry; if the crystals are soaked in 4-FBzOH, exchange of guests takes place, associated with the appearance of 21 symmetry between the guest molecules. The exchange from 3-FBzOH to water caused a drastic structural change accompanied by space group change from P21 to P6522. The exchange from 2-FBzOH to water afforded two types of CA-H2O structure: one has space group P6522 and the other has the bilayered structure with space group P21. In contrast to CA\u20142- and \u20143-FBzOH, the crystal of CA-4-FBzOH did not undergo any transformation. Several transformations accompany the conspicuous change in the hydrogen bond network which plays an important role in constructing the crystal lattice.

{"prompt": "Facile preparation of a Na2MnSiO4/C/graphene composite as a high performance cathode for sodium ion batteries\n\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry. A new class of Na2MnSiO4/carbon/graphene (Na2MnSiO4/C/G) composite is successfully prepared and investigated for use as a cathode material for Na ion batteries. X-ray diffraction confirms that formation of a monoclinic structure with Pn space group. Morphological characterization shows that Na2MnSiO4 nanoparticles, about 30-40 nm in size with high density, are homogeneously anchored on the whole surface of the crumpled micrometer-size graphene nanosheets. The sodium insertion-extraction process of Na2MnSiO4 is similar to that of Li2MnSiO4 as a cathode in Li ion batteries. Compared with the Na2MnSiO4/C composite, the Na2MnSiO4/C/G composite shows much better electrochemical performance, including excellent rate performance and capacity retention. At the rate of 0.1C (1C = 139 mA h g\u22121), the discharge capacity of the initial cycle is 182.4 mA h g\u22121, corresponding to 1.31 Na+ insertion per Na2MnSiO4 molecule. Even at high rates of 1C, 2C and 5C, the composite exhibits discharge capacities of 106.9, 80.3 and 60.7 mA h g\u22121, respectively. The enhanced electrochemical performance arises from the conductive graphene nanosheets, which facilitate the electronic conductivity of the composite, improve the contact area for the electrode/electrolyte interface and decrease the particles sizes of Na2MnSiO4, as well as can reduce the diffusion length of Na+ ions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"sodium ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Na2MnSiO4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"Pn\", \"monoclinic\"], \"description\": [\"nanoparticles\", \"composite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"sodium ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"carbon\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\", \"composite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"sodium ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"graphene\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\", \"composite\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"sodium ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Na2MnSiO4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"monoclinic\", \"Pn\"], \"description\": [\"nanoparticles\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"carbon\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"graphene\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"crumpled micrometer-size nanosheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"cathode\", \"Li ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Li2MnSiO4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Recent advances in titanium-based electrode materials for stationary sodium-ion batteries\nRecently, the attention to sodium-ion batteries has been refocused on large-scale energy storage applications, due to sodium's low cost and infinite abundance. Sodium is one of the most abundant elements on earth and exhibits chemical properties similar to lithium. Owing to their superior sodium storage capability especially for excellent safety and stability, Ti-based compounds have been extensively investigated as both cathode and anode materials. Herein we outline the current cathodes and anodes, and emphasize the critical roles of titanium in developing advanced electrodes for sodium-ion batteries.

{"prompt": "A stable, hydrogen-defect structure of post-perovskite (hy-ppv, Mg1\u2212x SiH2x O3) has been determined by first-principles calculations of the vibrational and elastic properties up to 150GPa. Among three potential hy-ppv structures analyzed, one was found to be stable at pressures relevant to the lower-mantle D\u2033 region. Hydrogen has a pronounced effect on the elastic properties of post-perovskite due to magnesium defects associated with hydration, including a reduction of the zero-pressure bulk (K 0) and shear (G 0) moduli by 5% and 8%, respectively, for a structure containing \u223c1wt.% H2O. However, with increasing pressure the moduli of hy-ppv increase significantly relative to ppv, resulting in a structure that is only 1% slower in bulk compressional velocity and 2.5% slower in shear-wave velocity than ppv at 120GPa. In contrast, the reduction of certain anisotropic elastic constants (Cij ) in hy-ppv increases with pressure (notably, C55, C66, and C23), indicating that hydration generally increases elastic anisotropy in hy-ppv at D\u2033 pressures. Calculated infrared absorption spectra show two O\u2013H stretching bands at \u223c3500cm\u22121 that shift with pressure to lower wavenumber by about 2cm\u22121/GPa. At 120GPa the hydrogen bonds in hy-ppv are still asymmetric. The stability of a hy-ppv structure containing 1\u20132wt.% H2O at D\u2033 pressures implies that post-perovskite may be a host for recycled or primordial hydrogen near the Earth\u2019s core-mantle boundary.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"hy-ppv,\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"post-perovskite\", \"formula\": \"Mg1\\u2212x SiH2x O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"ppv\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"MgSiO3\", \"formula\": \"Mg1\\u2212x SiH2x O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"post-perovskite\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"hy-ppv\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Mg1\\u2212x SiH2x O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"post-perovskite\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}

The fundamental properties of lead halide perovskites, rivaling those of conventional semiconductors, make these systems attractive not just for solar cells but also for a broader playground of energy and nanotechnology applications.

During magnetron sputtering at intermediary base pressures (~10\u22124Pa), the effect of these impurities can be estimated from the ratio of the impurity flux to the metallic flux. In this study, the influence of the ambient impurity flux on the growth mode of CoCrCuFeNi High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) thin films is investigated. It is shown that the impurity-to-metal flux ratio effectively controls the texture, grain size, porosity, and elastic properties of the nanocrystalline CoCrCuFeNi thin films.

{"prompt": "Thermoelectric properties of correlated double quantum dot system in Coulomb blockade regime\nWe theoretically study thermoelectric properties of a coupled double quantum dot (DQD) system coupled to normal leads using two impurity Anderson model with intra- as well as interdot Coulomb interactions. A generic formulation, which was earlier developed to study electronic properties (zero bias maximum of differential conductance and interesting partial swapping in Fano phenomena) of DQD system within Coulomb blockade regime for a non-magnetic case, is extended to investigate thermoelectric properties i.e. electrical conductance, thermoelectric power and thermal conductance of the same system, as a function of temperature by varying interdot Coulomb interaction and interdot tunneling. Interdot Coulomb interaction is found to trigger some novel features like crossover in thermoelectric power with temperature in all the configurations (series, parallel and T-shape) and a small peak in thermal conductance toward low temperatures, T\u2248\u0393/10, in series and T-shape configurations, which is found to be missing in case of symmetric parallel configuration. The origin of these novel features is attributed to the interplay of renormalization of energy levels caused by the interdot Coulomb interaction which is interpreted in terms of local density of states and the asymmetry effects related to dot-lead couplings/interference effects.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " []"}
{"prompt": "Fabrication and contact resistivity of W\u2013Si3N4/TiB2\u2013Si3N4/p\u2013SiGe thermoelectric joints\nThe design and fabrication of silicon germanium (SiGe) thermoelectric elements, typically including the selection of electrode and intermediate materials, the process of joining electrode and intermediate layer onto thermoelectric materials, are the major challenge for SiGe thermoelectric device technology. In this study, W\u2013Si3N4 and TiB2\u2013Si3N4 composites are designed as the electrode and intermediate layer, respectively, and the W\u2013i3N4/TiB2\u2013Si3N4/p\u2013Si80Ge20B0.6 joints are fabricated by a one-step spark plasma sintering process. The influences of the composition of TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer on the interfacial structure, contact resistivity and interfacial thermal stability are investigated. The interfacial thermal stability is improved with increasing Si3N4 content in TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer due to the reduced mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion between the intermediate layer and SiGe. On the other hand, the contact resistivity increases with the rising of Si3N4 content due to the weakened TiB2/SiGe ohmic contact, which degrades the device efficiency. As the balanced point, the intermediate layer with the composition of 80vol% TiB2+20vol% Si3N4 provides good interfacial thermal stability and moderately small contact resistivity (~75\u03bc\u03a9cm2 after aging at 1000\u00b0C for 120h) simultaneously, which is an optimized intermediate layer composition for W\u2013Si3N4/TiB2\u2013Si3N4/p\u2013Si80Ge20B0.6 thermoelectric element. The TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer has excellent chemical stability to both W\u2013Si3N4 electrode and SiGe thermoelectric material at high temperatures, which contributes to the sharp interface of the joint and effectively prevents the inter-diffusion between the electrode and the SiGe.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"electrode\", \"thermoelectric devices\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Si3N4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"composite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"intermediate layer\", \"thermoelectric devices\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"TiB2-Si3N4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"composite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"silicon germanium\", \"formula\": \"SiGe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"p-Ge20B0.6\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"silicon germanium\", \"formula\": \"SiGe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Si80Ge20B0.6\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Si3N4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"electrode\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"TiB2-Si3N4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"intermediate layer\"]}]"}

Fe2O3 is regarded as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high specific capacity. The large volume change during discharge and charge processes, however, induces significant cracking of the Fe2O3 anodes, leading to rapid fading of the capacity. Herein, a novel peapod-like nanostructured material, consisting of Fe2O3 nanoparticles homogeneously encapsulated in the hollow interior of N-doped porous carbon nanofibers, as a high-performance anode material is reported. The distinctive structure not only provides enough voids to accommodate the volume expansion of the pea-like Fe2O3 nanoparticles but also offers a continuous conducting framework for electron transport and accessible nanoporous channels for fast diffusion and transport of Li/Na-ions.

The superior performance of Co/CeO2(NC) catalysts is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including improved metal dispersion, increased reducibility and higher oxygen mobility.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"ethanol steam reforming\", \"catalyst\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Co/CeO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": []}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanorods\", \"nanocubes\", \"support\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"ethanol steam reforming\", \"catalyst\"], \"name\": \"Co\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"supported on ceria\", \"nano-rods\", \"nano-cubes\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"ethanol steam reforming\", \"catalyst support\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nano-rods\", \"nano-cubes\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"ethanol steam reforming\", \"catalyst\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Co/CeO2(NR)\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"ethanol steam reforming\", \"catalyst\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Co/CeO2(NC)\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Designing the morphology of ceria particles by precursor complexes\nCeria-based materials are widely used as catalysts, catalyst supports and electrolytes in many industrial applications. The morphological requirements of ceria particles vary depending on their applications. Here we show that complex morphologies of ceria particles can be achieved by using precursor complexes in the spray pyrolysis (SP) method. Three precursor complexes have been investigated: the complex of cerium acetate hydrate (CeA) and cerium nitrate hydrate (CeN); CeA and cerium ammonium nitrate (CeAN); and CeN and CeAN. Our results suggest that the morphological formation mechanism is highly correlated with the factors of precursor solubilities, solvent evaporation rates and precursor melting temperatures.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"catalyst support\", \"electrolyte\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"particles\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"cerium acetate hydrate\", \"formula\": \"CeA\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"precursor\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"cerium nitrate hydrate\", \"formula\": \"CeN\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"precursor\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"cerium ammonium nitrate\", \"formula\": \"CeAN\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"precursor\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"particles\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalysts\", \"catalyst supports\", \"electrolytes\"]}, {\"name\": \"cerium acetate hydrate\", \"formula\": \"CeA\", \"description\": [\"precursor complex\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"cerium nitrate hydrate\", \"formula\": \"CeN\", \"description\": [\"precursor complex\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"cerium ammonium nitrate\", \"formula\": \"CeAN\", \"description\": [\"precursor complex\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Five decades of homonuclear dipolar decoupling in solid-state NMR: Status and outlook\nIt has been slightly more than fifty years since the first homonuclear spin decoupling scheme, Lee-Goldburg decoupling, was proposed for removing homonuclear dipolar interactions in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. A family of such schemes has made observation of high-resolution NMR spectra of abundant spins possible in various applications in solid state.

{"prompt": "One-dimensional nanofiber architecture of an anatase TiO2-carbon composite with improved sodium storage performance\n\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016. Titanium-based oxides have been considered promising anode materials for rechargeable sodium (Na)-ion batteries (NIBs); however, the slow reaction kinetics of TiO2due to its low electrical conductivity remains a critical problem to be addressed for its practical application in NIBs. Here, we report one-dimensional (1D) TiO2-C composite nanofibers for use as an anode for NIBs, which were fabricated via an electrospinning technique combined with optimized heat-treatment. The TiO2-C composite nanofibers are composed of tiny anatase TiO2nanocrystals surrounded by and/or embedded in the conducting carbon matrix. When tested in an electrochemical Na cell, the TiO2-C nanofiber electrode retained a high charge capacity of 140 mA h g-1, even after 100 cycles at a current density of 60 mA g-1, and it exhibited excellent rate-capability (105 mA h g-1at 3 A g-1), proving its feasibility as an NIB anode. The superior Na storage performance of the nanofiber anode is mainly attributed to the unique composite architecture, that is, a large number of active sites per volume due to the high aspect ratios and short lengths for Na transport through 1D nanofibers and TiO2nanocrystals as well as highly conducting electron paths.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"anode\", \"sodium-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"titanium dioxide\", \"formula\": \"TiO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"anatase\"], \"description\": [\"nanofibers\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"carbon\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanofibers\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"TiO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"anatase\"], \"description\": [\"nanocrystals\", \"carbon composite\", \"nanofibers\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"carbon\", \"formula\": \"C\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"matrix\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Effect of ceria structural properties on the catalytic activity of Au\u2013CeO2 catalysts for WGS reaction\nTwo gold based catalysts supported on ceria prepared by different methods (urea gelation coprecipitation, UGC, and coprecipitation, CP) have been synthesized and tested in the WGS reaction, showing quite different catalytic behaviors. Interestingly, the two catalysts have the same gold loading (3 wt% Au was inserted by deposition\u2013precipitation) and the FTIR spectroscopy of the adsorbed CO revealed the same amount of gold exposed sites. With the aim to elucidate how the preparation method affects the properties of the support, a morphological, structural and textural characterization has been performed by HRTEM, XRD, BET and Raman analyses, as well as FTIR spectroscopy to probe both the Au and the support exposed sites. It was found that the UGC method gave rise to an enhancement of the defectivity of ceria and to an increase of the reactivity under reductive treatment. Further FTIR measurements of adsorbed acetone demonstrated the presence of two kinds of Ce4+ sites with different coordination, (CUS) Ce4+ A and (CUS) Ce4+ B, on the UGC sample. Such sites can influence the catalytic activity, possibly favoring the water dissociation, making ceria prepared by UGC a better support for Au catalysts than the CP-prepared one.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"WGS reaction\"], \"name\": \"gold\", \"formula\": \"Au\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"supported on ceria\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"WGS reaction\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name\": \"gold\", \"formula\": \"Au\", \"description\": [\"supported on ceria\", \"3 wt% Au\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"WGS reaction\"]}, {\"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"description\": [\"support\", \"Au catalyst\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"WGS reaction\"]}]"}

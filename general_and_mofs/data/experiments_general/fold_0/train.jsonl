{"prompt": "The testing of batteries linked to supercapacitors with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy: A comparison between Li-ion and valve regulated lead acid batteries\nFor electric vehicles, a supercapacitor can be coupled to the electrical system in order to increase and optimize the energy and power densities of the drive system during acceleration and regenerative breaking. This study looked at the charge acceptance and maximum discharge ability of a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) and a Li-ion battery connected in parallel to supercapacitors. The test procedure evaluated the advantage of using a supercapacitor at a 2\u00a0F:1\u00a0Ah ratio with the battery types at various states of charge (SoC). The results showed that about 7% of extra charge was achieved over a 5-s test time for a Li-ion hybrid system at 20% SoC, whereas at the 80% SoC the additional capacity was approximately 16%. While for the VRLA battery hybrid system, an additional charge of up to 20% was achieved when the battery was at 80% SoC, with little or no benefit at the 20% SoC. The advantage of the supercapacitor in parallel with a VRLA battery was noticeable on its discharge ability, where significant extra capacity was achieved for short periods of time for a battery at the 60% and 40% SoC when compared to the Li-ion hybrid system. The study also made use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with a suitable equivalent circuit model to explain, in particular, the internal resistance and capacitance differences observed between the different battery chemistries with and without a supercapacitor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "A long-lived lunar dynamo powered by core crystallization\nThe Moon does not possess an internally generated magnetic field at the present day, but extensive evidence shows that such a field existed between at least 4.2 and 3.56 Ga ago. The existence of a metallic lunar core is now firmly established, and we investigate the influence of inner core growth on generating a lunar core dynamo. We couple the results of a 3-D spherical thermochemical convection model of the lunar mantle to a 1-D thermodynamic model of its core. The energy and entropy budget of the core are computed to determine the inner core growth rate and its efficiency to power a dynamo. Sulfur is considered to be the main alloying element and we investigate how different sulfur abundances and initial core temperatures affect the model outcomes. For reasonable initial conditions, a solid inner core between 100 and 200 km is always produced. During its growth, a surface magnetic field of about 0.3 \u03bcT is generated and is predicted to last several billion years. Though most simulations predict the existence of a core dynamo at the present day, one way to stop magnetic field generation when the inner core is growing is by a transition between a bottom\u2013up and top\u2013down core crystallization scheme when the sulfur content becomes high enough in the outer core. According to this hypothesis, a model with about 6 to 8 wt.% sulfur in the core would produce a 120\u2013160 km inner core and explain the timing of the lunar dynamo as constrained by paleomagnetic data.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Solid-state conversion of single crystals: The principle and the state-of-the-art\n\u00a9 2015 The American Ceramic Society. Solid-state conversion of single crystals from polycrystalline materials has the advantages of cost-effectiveness, chemical homogeneity, and versatility over the conventional melt growth and solution growth methods, particularly for systems with high melting points, incongruent melting, high reactivity (volatility), and phase transformations at high temperature. Nevertheless, for commercial production, this technique has only been successful in a few limited systems, in particular ferroelectric systems. This is mostly because of the difficulty in controlling the microstructure, particularly suppressing grain growth in the polycrystal during its conversion. This article describes the principle and the current status of the solid-state conversion of single crystals. We first introduce the recently developed principle of microstructural evolution to explain the basis of the microstructure control in polycrystals for solid-state conversion. We then report recent technical developments in fabricating single crystals by the solid-state single crystal growth (SSCG) method and their physical properties. The SSCG method is expected to be studied and utilized more widely in fabricating single crystals with complex compositions as a strong alternative to the melt growth and solution growth methods.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Assessment of Solder Joint Fatigue Life Under Realistic Service Conditions\nThe behavior of lead-free solder alloys under complex loading scenarios is still not well understood. Common damage accumulation rules fail to account for strong effects of variations in cycling amplitude, and random vibration test results cannot be interpreted in terms of performance under realistic service conditions. This is a result of the effects of cycling parameters on materials properties. These effects are not yet fully understood or quantitatively predictable, preventing modeling based on parameters such as strain, work, or entropy. Depending on the actual spectrum of amplitudes, Miner\u2019s rule of linear damage accumulation has been shown to overestimate life by more than an order of magnitude, and greater errors are predicted for other combinations. Consequences may be particularly critical for so-called environmental stress screening. Damage accumulation has, however, been shown to scale with the inelastic work done, even if amplitudes vary. This and the observation of effects of loading history on subsequent work per cycle provide for a modified damage accumulation rule which allows for the prediction of life. Individual joints of four different Sn-Ag-Cu-based solder alloys (SAC305, SAC105, SAC-Ni, and SACXplus) were cycled in shear at room temperature, alternating between two different amplitudes while monitoring the evolution of the effective stiffness and work per cycle. This helped elucidate general trends and behaviors that are expected to occur in vibrations of microelectronics assemblies. Deviations from Miner\u2019s rule varied systematically with the combination of amplitudes, the sequences of cycles, and the strain rates in each. The severity of deviations also varied systematically with Ag content in the solder, but major effects were observed for all the alloys. A systematic analysis was conducted to assess whether scenarios might exist in which the more fatigue-resistant high-Ag alloys would fail sooner than the lower-Ag ones.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SAC305\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SAC105\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SAC-Ni\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"solder\"], \"name\": \"SACXplus\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Serration and noise behaviors in materials\nSerration and noise behaviors in plastically deforming solids are related to avalanches of deformation processes. In the stress-strain curves, the serration characteristics are visible as stress drops or strain jumps. In fact, similar serration characteristics are ubiquitous in many structural and functional materials, such as amorphous materials [also metallic glasses, or bulk metallic glasses (BMGs)], high-entropy alloys (HEAs), superalloys, ordered intermetallics, shape-memory alloys (SMAs), electrochemical noise, carbon steels, twinning-induced plasticity steels (TWIP steels), phase-transformation-induced plasticity steels (TRIP steels), Al-Mg alloys, nano-materials, magnetic functional materials, and so on. Because of their unique and universal properties, many researchers have focused on this field to find out what causes the serration behaviors and what can be learned about the material from the serration characteristics. For example, the serration characteristics contain information about the mechanisms of plastic deformation and the structural evolution during deformation. However, due to many factors affecting the serration behavior and some uncertain or uncontrolled factors, it\u2019s a difficult task to give a unified picture of a vast amount of serration data. This review article summarizes the results of previous studies in this rapidly-developing field, attempting to provide a new perspective in expounding the connection between macroscopic properties and micro-mechanisms.In this review paper, serration behavior of a wide range of materials will be discussed. One of the most important goals is to investigate the factors influencing serration characteristics and deformation mechanisms. Several statistical properties, such as distributions of stress drop sizes and waiting times, are reviewed and used to quantify the serration behavior. Moreover, models and theories on the serrated flow will be discussed, which quantify the deformation mechanism and provide physical intuition for the experiments, and methods to organize experimental data. Besides discussing serrations in stress-strain curves of many solid materials, this review paper will also cover other systems with serrations and collective noise, such as crackling noise in the earth\u2019s crust (earthquakes), volume fluctuations in a granular medium and jamming behavior in random-packing systems.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "On the correlation between thermoelectricity and adhesive tool wear during blanking of aluminum sheets\nBlanking is one of the most frequently used manufacturing processes. Its profitability strongly depends on the development of tool wear, since this determines the decisive factors of part quality, process stability and service intervals. Reducing the wear can only be achieved by gaining a sufficient understanding of the interactions which cause it. One important factor in this context is the temperature increase in the shear zone due to the partial dissipation of inelastic work. The resulting temperature gradient in the tool, combined with the electric contact between the workpiece and the tool, generates thermoelectric voltages and currents. The thermoelectric currents are suspected to have an especially strong influence on adhesive wear, but the mutual correlation between them during blanking operations is not clear. Therefore, several blanking examinations were carried out with the aluminum alloy 5083.

A density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been performed to analyze the structure of both the extractor and the titanium(iv)-extractor complex to rationalize the sorption pathway. The systematic studies on the solid phase extraction of titanium(iv) ensured its quantitative sorption at solution pH: 5.0-6.0, influent volume: 1000 mL, analyte concentration: 23.95-35.92 \u03bcg mL-1, flow rate: 2.5 mL min-1, temperature: 27 \u00b0C, time of equilibration: 1.5 minutes and stress of foreign ions concentration (Cl-, SO42-, ClO4- and NO3-): 200 \u03bcg mL-1. The extractor, i.e., SSG-V10 (29567.465 eV; \u03b7 = 3.671 eV), has a high BET surface area (149.46 m2 g-1), a good value of exchange capacity (2.54 meq. of H+ g-1 of dry SSG-V10), break-through capacity (Q0 = 37.4-40.7 \u03bcg mg -1) and column efficiency (N: 108) with respect to titanium(iv). The +ve \u0394H (0.048 kJ mol-1), \u0394S (5 J K-1 mol -1) and -ve \u0394G (-1.1488 kJ mol-1) indicate that the sorption process was endothermic, entropy-gaining and spontaneous in nature. The DFT calculations reveal that the guest, [(OH)(H2O)Ti(-\u03bcO) 2(OH)(H2O)]+2 (15531.185 eV; \u03b7 = 3.39 eV), is stabilized as a syn isomer. This syn isomer was then placed at the exchange site and a second DFT calculation was performed. It was found that the hydrogen bonded anti complex gets stabilized by 0.286 eV over the syn isomer as the extracted species. The loading of titanium(iv) has been confirmed by EDX. The sorbed titanium(iv) was eluted as a distinct and detectable color with 1 M HCl containing H2O2. The preconcentration factor has been optimized at 60.8 \u00b1 0.5.

{"prompt": "Sampling based State of Health estimation methodology for Li-ion batteries\nStorage and management of energy is becoming a more and more important problem every day, especially for electric and hybrid vehicle applications. Li-ion battery is one of the most important technological alternatives for high capacity energy storage and related industrial applications. State of Health (SoH) of Li-ion batteries plays a critical role in their deployment from economic, safety, and availability aspects. Most, if not all, of the studies related to SoH estimation focus on the measurement of a new parameter/physical phenomena related to SoH, or development of new statistical/computational methods using several parameters. This paper presents a new approach for SoH estimation for Li-ion battery systems with multiple battery cells: The main idea is a new circuit topology which enables separation of battery cells into two groups, main and test batteries, whenever a SoH related measurement is to be conducted. All battery cells will be connected to the main battery during the normal mode of operation. When a measurement is needed for SoH estimation, some of the cells will be separated from the main battery, and SoH estimation related measurements will be performed on these units. Compared to classical SoH measurement methods which deal with whole battery system, the proposed method estimates the SoH of the system by separating a small but representative set of cells. While SoH measurements are conducted on these isolated cells, remaining cells in the main battery continue to function in normal mode, albeit in slightly reduced performance levels. Preliminary experimental results are quite promising, and validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Technical details of the proposed circuit architecture are also summarized in the paper.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Battery capacity degradation prediction using similarity recognition based on modified dynamic time warping\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. Battery degradation prediction is a significant recent challenge given the complex physical and chemical processes that occur within batteries, various working conditions, and limited performance degradation data and/or ground test data. In this study, we describe an approach called dynamic spatial time warping, which is used to determine the similarities of two arbitrary curves. Unlike classical dynamic time warping methods, this approach can maintain the invariance of curve similarity to the rotations and translations of curves, which is vital in curve similarity search and can recognize the intrinsic relationship between two curves. Moreover, it can be applied for battery degradation prediction even when rare data are available and do not require special assumptions, which fulfill the requirements of degradation prediction for batteries subject to extreme limited available data. The accuracy of this approach is verified by using both simulation data and NASA battery datasets. Results suggest that the proposed approach provides a highly accurate path of predicting battery degradation even with very limited data.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Manipulating pressure and shear waves in dielectric elastomers via external electric stimuli\nWe investigate elastic wave propagation in finitely deformed dielectric elastomers in the presence of an electrostatic field. To analyze the propagation of both longitudinal (P-) and transverse (S-) waves, we utilize compressible material models. We derive explicit expressions for the generalized acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for ideal and enriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of elastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In particular, P-and S-waves can be separated by applying an electric field. The divergence angle between P-and S-waves strongly depends on the applied electrostatic excitation. The influence of an electric field depends on the choice of a material model. In the case of the ideal dielectric model, the in-plane shear wave velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model the velocity may decrease depending on material constants. The divergence angle also gradually increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model the angle variation may be limited. Material compressibility affects the P-wave velocity, and for relatively compressible materials the slowness curve of the P-wave evolves from circular to elliptical shape manifesting in an increase in the refraction angle of the P-wave. As a result, the divergence angle decreases with an increase in material compressibility.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "A novel approach of battery pack state of health estimation using artificial intelligence optimization algorithm\nAn accurate battery pack state of health (SOH) estimation is important to characterize the dynamic responses of battery pack and ensure the battery work with safety and reliability. However, the different performances in battery discharge/charge characteristics and working conditions in battery pack make the battery pack SOH estimation difficult. In this paper, the battery pack SOH is defined as the change of battery pack maximum energy storage. It contains all the cells' information including battery capacity, the relationship between state of charge (SOC) and open circuit voltage (OCV), and battery inconsistency. To predict the battery pack SOH, the method of particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm is applied in battery pack model parameters identification. Based on the results, a particle filter is employed in battery SOC and OCV estimation to avoid the noise influence occurring in battery terminal voltage measurement and current drift. Moreover, a recursive least square method is used to update cells' capacity. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the profiles of New European Driving Cycle and dynamic test profiles.

When a study was carried out in a solution of sodium ions, in the material structure K+ and Rb+ were progressively displaced by the sodium ions, which was ascribed to their higher mobility. However, when an experiment was conducted using a solution containing Cs+ or in an aqueous solution of NaNO3, from Zn3Cs2[FeII(CN)6]2, the mixed composition Zn3NaCs[FeII(CN)6]2 was formed. The results discussed here are supported by the electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements. Galvanostatic experiments on the Zn3Cs2[FeII(CN)6]2 system in a solution of sodium ions revealed a capacity retention of 75% during 40 charge/discharge cycles.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"coordination polymer\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Zn3Na2[FeII(CN)6]2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"open porous framework\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Zn3[FeIII(CN)6]2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Zn3Cs2[FeII(CN)6]2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Zn3NaCs[FeII(CN)6]2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Thermal processes in the systems with Li-battery cathode materials and LiPF6 -based organic solutions\nThermodynamic instability of positive electrodes (cathodes) in Li-ion batteries in humid air and battery solutions results in capacity fading and batteries degradation, especially at elevated temperatures.

The thermal decomposition of the electrolyte solutions starts >180\u00a0\u00b0C. The macro-structural transformations of cathode materials upon exothermic reactions were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray difraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies have shown that the exothermic reactions in the temperature range of 60\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0C lead to partial decomposition of both the cathode material and electrolyte solution. The systems thus formed consisted of partially decomposed solutions and partially chemically delithiated cathode materials covered by reactions products. Thermal reactions terminate and this system reaches equilibrium at about 120\u00a0\u00b0C. It remains stable up to the beginning of the solution decomposition at about 180\u00a0\u00b0C.

{"prompt": "Functional binders as graphite exfoliation suppressants in aggressive electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries\nA comparative study of various electrode binders for graphite electrodes was conducted in a carbonate-based electrolyte with a high content of propylene carbonate (PC) as a means to evaluate anode degradation in presence of different binders. Because of its direct contact with the active material, a binder can be interpreted as an interfacial layer and as a local part of the electrolyte, the properties of which greatly depend on the interaction with the liquid electrolyte. In this work we demonstrate how a carefully chosen binder can create a specific surface environment that can protect graphite from exfoliation when the binder exhibits poor solubility in the electrolyte solvent and good surface adhesion to the active material. The exceptional stability of graphite electrodes containing poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt (PAA-Na) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), respectively, in a PC-rich electrolyte is explained through the understanding of binder swelling and functionality. Interfacial resistances and electrochemical stability were investigated with impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling. Electrode morphologies and distributions of material were analysed with SEM and EDX. Evidence is presented that the surface selectivity increases with concentration of functional groups and polymer flexibility. Therefore only the less selective, stiff polymer with less functional groups, CMC-Na, provides sufficient protection at low binder contents.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"PAA-Na\", \"applications\": [\"electrode binder\"], \"name\": \"poly(acrylic acid) sodium salt\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"CMC-Na\", \"applications\": [\"electrode binder\"], \"name\": \"carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"graphite\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"anode\", \"lithium-ion batteries\"]}, {\"name\": \"propylene carbonate\", \"formula\": \"\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"PC\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"electrolyte\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "A new family of cermets: Chemically complex but microstructurally simple\nCermets based on Ti(C,N) have interesting properties, such as high wear resistance, high chemical stability and good mechanical strength at high temperature, but to become a viable alternative to cemented carbides, the fracture toughness and damage tolerance must be significantly improved. Complete solid-solution cermets (CSCs) have been proposed to further improve the mechanical properties of these materials. However, to develop this family of cermets with a high level of quality and reliability, using pre-fabricated complex carbonitrides is necessary instead of unalloyed mixtures as the raw ceramic material. A mechanochemical process called mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) is suitable to obtain these complex carbonitrides with high stoichiometric control. On the other hand, high entropy alloys (HEAs), which can also be obtained by mechanochemical processes, are a good candidate to replace the current binder phase in cermets because they exhibit high strength and ductility at high temperature and good resistance to both wear and corrosion.

Currently, there is no method to evaluate the stress inside a battery. This paper presents a finite element based multi-scale approach for the stress analysis of the separator in a battery cell.

The shape evolution process of Au nanoparticles under different fabrication conditions is studied, and a thermodynamic model is adopted to explain the shape transition. Single-crystalline Au nanoprisms with regular hexagonal shape can be formed at a certain annealing temperature. Coating of these Au nanoprisms with graphene causes them to exhibit a SERS enhancement of 60x. This is the first demonstration of a physical approach to fabricate regular hexagonal Au nanoprisms that exhibit an ultrasensitive SERS effect. Furthermore, the local field distribution of a series of Au nanoprisms with different sizes is simulated to better understand their ultrasensitive SERS performance.

{"prompt": "Electrical conductivity of PUR/MWCNT nanocomposites in the molten state, during crystallization and in the solid state\nThe electrical conductivity of a nanocomposite constituted of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersed in a semicrystalline polyurethane matrix, is investigated during cooling from the melt to the solid state. The same percolation threshold, \u03d5c=0.85wt.%, is obtained in the molten and in the solid state, although the exponent t of the percolation equation is significantly higher in the solid state. A remarkable increase of the conductivity during crystallization is observed for nanocomposites of MWCNT content above \u03d5c, but for contents below \u03d5c the conductivity decreases. Combined conductivity and PVT results, lead us to discard the hypothesis of an increase of the density of the conductive network (associated with volume shrinkage) as being the cause of the conductivity enhancement during crystallization. Instead, the analysis of the parameters of the percolation equation for the molten and the solid state, suggests a transition from a less effective conductive network to a more performing three dimensional network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"PUR\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"polyurethane\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"semicrystalline\", \"matrix\", \"nanocomposite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"MWCNT\", \"applications\": [\"conductive network\"], \"name\": \"carbon\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"multiwalled nanotubes\", \"nanocomposite\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The distinctive structure not only provides enough voids to accommodate the volume expansion of the pea-like Fe2O3 nanoparticles but also offers a continuous conducting framework for electron transport and accessible nanoporous channels for fast diffusion and transport of Li/Na-ions. As a consequence, this peapod-like structure exhibits a stable discharge capacity of 1434 mAh g\u22121 (at 100 mA g\u22121) and 806 mAh g\u22121 (at 200 mA g\u22121) over 100 cycles as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, respectively.

However, the fatigue and fracture studies on BMGs are limited so far, compared to other mechanical properties. The present work reviews the fatigue and fracture behavior of BMGs and their composites, as well as that of metallic-glass films, ribbons, and wires. The grand challenge for the fatigue and fracture performance of BMGs is: What produces a large difference among the fatigue and fracture results of BMGs? According to the fatigue and fracture investigations of crystalline alloys including recently invented high entropy alloys, many factors could be involved, such as the composition, material quality, specimen geometry, chemical environment, surface condition, temperature, cyclic frequency, mean stress, and residual stress, etc. Based on this challenge, the present work will review and address the factors affecting the fatigue and fracture behavior of BMGs and their composites. Furthermore, the mechanisms of fatigue-crack initiation, propagation, and fracture of BMGs and their composites in different loading conditions and environments will be outlined, analyzed, and discussed. Future research directions of fatigue and fracture of BMGs and their composites are provided for reference.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Impurity-controlled film growth and elastic properties of CoCrCuFeNi thin films\nThe growth mode during physical vapor deposition of metallic thin films is very sensitive to the presence of impurity species. These impurities can originate from the residual ambient gases present in the vacuum chamber and usually impede continued crystal growth by inducing renucleation. During magnetron sputtering at intermediary base pressures (~10\u22124Pa), the effect of these impurities can be estimated from the ratio of the impurity flux to the metallic flux. In this study, the influence of the ambient impurity flux on the growth mode of CoCrCuFeNi High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) thin films is investigated. It is shown that the impurity-to-metal flux ratio effectively controls the texture, grain size, porosity, and elastic properties of the nanocrystalline CoCrCuFeNi thin films. A less clear (111) fiber texture is observed at higher impurity-to-metal flux ratio. With increasing impurity-to-metal flux ratio the grain size decreases while the porosity increases. The elastic constants, and Young's modulus for CoCrCuFeNi is reported to be the highest for the \u3008111\u3009 direction. Hence, the change in film texture also affects the elastic constants and Young's modulus which tend to become lower as more grains with different orientation are observed at higher flux ratios. This study demonstrates that an exact knowledge of the impurity-to-metal flux ratio, or otherwise stated, of the base pressure and deposition rate during sputter deposition is imperative for the synthesis of HEA films with reproducible properties.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"High-Entropy Alloy\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"CoCrCuFeNi\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanocrystalline\", \"thin film\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Herein is chronicled the first report of pseudocapacitance in a system devoid of liquid electrolytes, using the cathode material LiTiS2. It is demonstrated that due to extreme crystallite reduction to less than 3 nm, additional charge storage is derived by reducing surface Ti3+ to Ti2+ at higher voltages and more reversibly than traditionally shown. Due to facile diffusion pathways in 3-fold coordinated lithium along the TiS2 surfaces, disordered LiTiS2 can be used as a singular cathode without conductive additives.

In the presence of low- and high-temperature fluids, temperature differences can be created across thermoelectric devices to produce electricity so that the heat dissipated from the hot side of a thermoelectric device will be absorbed by the cold liquid and this preheated liquid enters the heating cycle and increases the efficiency of the heater. Consequently, because of the avoidance of waste heat on the thermoelectric hot side, the efficiency of heat-to-electricity conversion with this configuration is better than that of conventional thermoelectric power generation systems. This research aims to design and analyze a thermoelectric power generation system based on the concept described above and using a low-grade heat source. This system may be used to generate electricity either in direct conjunction with any renewable energy source which produces hot water (solar thermal collectors) or using waste hot water from industry.

{"prompt": "Thermal analysis of lithium-ion batteries\nA detailed three-dimensional thermal model has been developed to examine the thermal behaviour of a lithium-ion battery. This model precisely considers the layered-structure of the cell stacks, the case of a battery pack, and the gap between both elements to achieve a comprehensive analysis. Both location-dependent convection and radiation are adopted at boundaries to reflect different heat dissipation performances on all surfaces. Furthermore, a simplified thermal model is proposed according to the examination of various simplification strategies and validation from the detailed thermal model. Based on the examination, the calculation speed of the simplified model is comparable with that of a one-dimensional model with a maximum error less than 0.54K.

Based on the simulation results from the detailed thermal model, radiation could contribute 43\u201363% at most to the overall heat dissipation under natural convection. Forced convection is effective in depressing the maximum temperature, and the temperature uniformity does not necessarily decrease infinitely when the extent of forced convection is enhanced. The metal battery case serves as a heat spreader, and the contact layer provides extra thermal resistance and heat capacity for the system. These factors are important and should be considered seriously in the design of battery systems.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Impact of solid state properties on developability assessment of drug candidates\nSolid state properties including polymorphism, solvate and salt formation can have a profound impact on two of the most important properties that are essential to the successful development of drug candidates: solubility and stability. To enable meaningful evaluations of drug candidates for their development risks, often referred to as developability, and provide input to the molecular design regarding the \u201cdrug-like\u201d properties, one must take into account the impact of solid state properties on solubility and stability. This review examines the importance of solid state properties and their relationship to developability criteria. Phase appropriate characterization strategies and appropriate salt and crystal form screening and selection processes are discussed. These strategies and processes should balance the need for speed and throughput of modern discovery with the quality of data essential to the adequate developability assessment.

{"prompt": "Microcutting of Multi-layer Foils with IR and Green ns-pulsed Fibre Lasers for Li-Ion Batteries\nLi-Ion batteries are crucial components in mobile devices that range from cellular phones to electrical vehicles. With the increasing demand in the market for these devices, manufacturers are required to reduce production cycle times. The main components of the Li-Ion batteries are anode and cathode foils, which are cut in required forms by punching. These materials consist of Cu sheets sandwiched between graphite layers for anode, and Al sheets sandwiched between Li metal oxide layers for cathode. In punching, the process quality degrades in time due to tool wear. This eventually causes machine down times for tool repair or change, which can increase the whole process cycle time drastically. Laser remote cutting based on ablation can be adequate solution to substitute the current technology, if the cutting edge quality and productivity can be matched to punching. This paper investigates laser microcutting of Li-Ion battery anode and cathode thin foils with ns-pulsed fibre lasers. These laser sources are cost effective and provide industrially robust operation. Two systems operating with 1\u03bcm and 0.5\u03bcm wavelength and 250ns and 1ns pulse durations respectively were compared.

Ammonium vanadyl salts were prepared by solid-state reaction between acidic vanadyl salts and urea at 250\u00b0C. Importance of hydration state or exposure to water vapor on the preparation and structure of acidic vanadyl salts was revealed. Solid solution of acidic vanadyl salts with cubic Fd3 \u00afm lattice can be obtained. Exposure of ammonium vanadyl salts to water vapor gives rise to a rebuilding of at least the surface of the particles leading to segregation into a pure ammonium Pn3 \u00afm phase and a pure highly hydrated vanadyl Fd3 \u00afm phase. Catalytic behavior of bulk solids for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid at 320\u00b0C was determined in presence of water. For ammonium vanadyl salts, the yield in methacrylic acid increases as the proportion of vanadyl phase increases until 0.75 VO2+ per polyanion and then a plateau is reached. This observation is consistent with the characterizations suggesting that these salts are composed of a core of ammonium salt embedded in hydrated vanadyl salt.

{"prompt": "Co-catalytic Effects of CoS 2 on the Activity of the MoS 2 Catalyst for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society.  MoS 2 is a promising material to replace the Pt catalyst in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is well known that the activity of the MoS 2 catalyst in the HER is significantly promoted by doping cobalt atoms. Recently, the Co-Mo-S phase, in which cobalt atoms decorate the edge positions of the MoS 2 slabs, has been identified as a co-catalytic phase in the Co-doped MoS 2 (Co-MoS x ) with low Co content. Here, we report the effect of the incorporation of cobalt atoms in the chemical state of the Co-MoS x catalyst, which gives rise to the co-catalytic effect. Co-MoS x catalysts with various Co contents were prepared on carbon fiber paper by a simple hydrothermal process. On the Co-MoS x catalyst with high Co content (Co/Mo \u2248 2.3), a dramatically higher catalytic activity was observed compared to that for the catalyst with low Co content (Co/Mo \u2248 0.36). Furthermore, the co-catalytic phase in the Co-MoS x catalyst with the high Co content was found not to be the Co-Mo-S phase but was identified as CoS 2 by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. It is believed that CoS 2 is an alternative choice to co-catalyze HER on MoS 2 -based catalysts.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"electrocatalyst\", \"hydrogen evolution reaction\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MoS2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"Co-doped\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"hydrogen evolution reaction\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pt\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Co-MoSx\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"hydrogen evolution reaction\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"CoS2\", \"description\": [\"co-catalytic phase\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"co-catalyst\", \"hydrogen evolution reaction\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Copper-ceria sheets catalysts: Effect of copper species on catalytic activity in CO oxidation reaction\n\u00a9 2017 Copper-ceria sheets catalysts with different loadings of copper (2 wt.%, 5 wt.% and 10 wt.%) supported on ceria nanosheets were synthesized via a deposition\u2013precipitation (DP) method. The prepared catalysts were systematically characterized with various structural and textural detections including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR), and tested for the CO oxidation reaction. Notably, the sample containing 5 wt.% of Cu exhibited the best catalytic performance as a result of the highest number of active CuO species on the catalyst surface. Further increase of copper content strongly affects the dispersion of copper and thus leads to the formation of less active bulk CuO phase, which was verified by XRD and H2-TPR analysis. Moreover, on the basis of in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in-situ DRIFTS) results, the surface Cu+ species, which are derived from the reduction of Cu2+, are likely to play a crucial role in the catalyzing CO oxidation. Consequently, the superior catalytic performance of the copper-ceria sheets is mainly attributed to the highly dispersed CuOx cluster rather than Cu-[Ox]-Ce structure, while the bulk CuO phase is adverse to the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"CO oxidation reaction\"], \"name\": \"copper\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"supported on ceria nanosheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"CuO\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"bulk\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"sheets\", \"nanosheets\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

The phase structure, the morphology, the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the powders were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and a vibrating sample magnetometer. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction patterns shows that all specimens crystallize in the tetragonal system with I4/mcm space group. Increasing the milling time up to 16h, the average crystallites size decreases to the nanoscale (\u223c36nm).

{"prompt": "Design of Effective Catalysts for Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation by Doping of Ceria with a Single-Atom Promotor\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society. Since the discovery that ceria is an active catalyst for selective hydrogenation of alkynes, there has been much debate on the catalytic mechanism. In this work, we propose, based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations, a mechanism that involves the heterolytic dissociation of H2 at oxygen vacancies of CeO2(111), facilitated by frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of spatially separated O and Ce sites. The resulting O-H and Ce-H species effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of acetylene, avoiding the overstabilization of the C2H3\u2217 intermediate in a previously proposed mechanism. On the basis of our mechanism, we propose the doping of ceria by Ni as a means to create oxygen vacancies. Interestingly, the Ni dopant is not directly involved in the catalytic reaction, but serves as a single-atom promoter. Experimental studies confirm the design principles and demonstrate much higher activity for Ni-doped ceria in selective hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined results from DFT calculations and experiment provide a basis to further develop selective hydrogenation catalysts based on earth-abundant materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"selective hydrogenation of alkynes\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"Ni-doped\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "An Insight into Sodiation of Antimony from First-Principles Crystal Structure Prediction\nElemental antimony has recently become an attractive anode material for potential application in rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. I present a first-principles study of the structure\u2013composition dependence of the Na\u2013Sb system for both sodiation and desodiation processes. The enthalpy of reaction of x moles of sodium with the hexagonal structure of antimony reveals several stable crystal structures for 0\u00a0<\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a03, with variable composition states for 1.25\u00a0<\u00a0x\u00a0<\u00a02.75.

Near and up to the sh phase structure we find the unusual case of stability at constant volume, but, as observed, instability at constant pressure p. Two special computational procedures are discussed, which locate the unstable ranges of structure.

{"prompt": "Decoherence and gate performance of coupled solid-state qubits\nSolid-state quantum bits are promising candidates for the realization of a scalable quantum computer. However, they are usually strongly limited by decoherence due to the many extra degrees of freedom of a solid-state system. We investigate a system of two solid-state qubits that are coupled via [Formula Presented] type of coupling. This kind of setup is typical for pseudospin solid-state quantum bits such as charge or flux systems. We evaluate decoherence properties and gate quality factors in the presence of a common and two uncorrelated baths coupling to [Formula Presented] respectively. We show that at low temperatures, uncorrelated baths do degrade the gate quality more severely. In particular, we show that in the case of a common bath, optimum gate performance of a controlled-PHASE gate can be reached at very low temperatures, because our type of coupling commutes with the coupling to the decoherence, which makes this type of coupling interesting as compared to previously studied proposals with [Formula Presented] coupling.

{"prompt": "Energy efficiency of Li-ion battery packs re-used in stationary power applications\nThe effects of capacity fade, energy efficiency fade, failure rate, and charge/discharge profile are investigated for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries based on first use in electric vehicles (EVs) and second-use in energy storage systems (ESS). The research supports the feasibility of re-purposing used Li-ion batteries from EVs for use in ESS. Based on data extrapolation from previous studies with a low number of charge/discharge cycles, it is estimated that the EV battery loses 20% of its capacity during its first use in the vehicle and a further 15% after its second use in the ESS over 10years. As energy efficiency decreases with increased charge/discharge cycles, a capacity fade model is used to approximate the effect of the relationship between cycles and capacity fade over the life of the battery. The performance of the battery in its second use is represented using a model of degradation modes, assuming a 0.01% cell failure rate and a non-symmetric charge/discharge profile. Finally, an accurate modeling of battery performance is used to examine energy savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction benefits from using a Li-ion battery first in an EV and then in an ESS connected to the Ontario electrical grid.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

Recent research on drivers and development of proxies applied to support space weather modeling efforts are presented, with emphasis on solar radiation indices, solar wind drivers and ionospheric indices. The models are discussed in groups corresponding to the physical effects they are dealing with, i.e. bottomside ionospheric effects, trans-ionospheric effects, neutral density and scale height variations, and spectacular space weather effects such as auroral emissions. Another group of models dealing with global circulation are presented here to demonstrate 3D modeling of the space environment.

{"prompt": "Activation analysis study on Li-ion batteries for nuclear forensic applications\nThe nuclear materials environment has been increasing significantly in complexity over the past couple of decades. The prevention of attacks from nuclear weapons is becoming more difficult, and nuclear forensics is a deterrent by providing detailed information on any type of nuclear event for proper attribution. One component of the nuclear forensic analysis is a measurement of the neutron spectrum. As an example, the neutron component provides information on the composition of the weapons, whether boosting is involved or the mechanisms used in creating a supercritical state. As 6Li has a large cross-section for thermal neutrons, the lithium battery is a primary candidate for assessing the neutron spectrum after detonation. The absorption process for 6Li yields tritium, which can be measured at a later point after the nuclear event, as long as the battery can be processed in a manner to successfully extract the tritium content. In addition, measuring the activated constituents after exposure provides a means to reconstruct the incident neutron spectrum. The battery consists of a spiral or folded layers of material that have unique, energy dependent interactions associated with the incident neutron flux. A detailed analysis on the batteries included a pre-irradiated mass spectrometry analysis to be used as input for neutron spectrum reconstruction. A set of batteries were exposed to a hard neutron spectrum delivered by the University of Massachusetts, Lowell research reactor Fast Neutron Irradiator (FNI). The gamma spectra were measured from the batteries within a few days and within a week after the exposure to obtain sufficient data on the activated materials in the batteries. The activity was calculated for a number of select isotopes, indicating the number of associated neutron interactions. The results from tritium extraction are marginal. A measurable increase in detected particles (gammas and betas) below 50keV not self-attenuated by the battery was observed, yet as the spectra are coarse, the gamma information is not separable from tritium spectra. The activation analysis was successful, and the incident neutron spectrum was reconstructed using materials found in lithium batteries.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

Furthermore, based on fuzzy inference system (FIS), the predicted model of the degradation degree for lithium-ion battery was built and its output was defined as the degenerate coefficient \u03b2, \u03b2 [0, 1]. Finally, by learning, training and simulating, the FIS model has been validated to be reliable and applicable in prediction on the degradation degree of lithium-ion battery.

Methods Specimens at varying thicknesses of 19 shades of skin-colored MFE were made incorporating tan, red, yellow and black pigments. Using a non-contact 45\u00b0/0\u00b0 spectral reflectance system, reflectance values were obtained and fit by non-linear regression to corrected K\u2013M theory to determine observed K and S values. Predicted values were calculated using: first order linear regression model (M1), second order square-factor model (M2S), second order interaction-factor model (M2I) and complete second order model (M2C). Errors between observed and predicted values for each model at each wavelength studied are evaluated. Differences in color and the Translucency Parameter (TP) at a thickness of 1.5mm based on CIE2000 color difference formula between observed and predicted values were also analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA (\u03b1=0.05). Results M2C shows less absolute differences in color and TP (1.5mm) than those for the M1 and M2S models (P<0.05).

{"prompt": "Discussing the use of modified ceria as support for Pt catalysts on water\u2013gas shift reaction\nCeO2 was doped with 25wt.% of MeO x (Me=Zr, Sm, or La) and Ce75Me25 mixed oxides were obtained. Pt (1wt.%) was then deposited on these oxides and CeO2. The resulting catalysts were tested for the water\u2013gas shift (WGS) reaction in a mixture whose composition was 5.49% CO, 4.10% CO2, 9.71% H2, 30.75% H2O. Subsequently, CeO2 was loaded with various levels of ZrO2 (y wt.%), which gave another set of Ce100\u2212y Zr y (y =25, 40, 50, and 75) supports and the respective catalysts were also tested for the WGS. While XRD analysis showed that all the mixed oxides had retained the cubic structure of CeO2, Raman analysis suggested that the doped ceria supports contain more oxygen vacancies resulting in higher oxygen mobility than CeO2, which were corroborated by the TPR analyses of all modified catalysts. However, only catalysts of the Pt/CeZr family produced larger CO conversions than Pt/CeO2 (except for Pt/Ce25Zr75) indicating that reducibility is not a crucial factor to improve WGS activity. The chemical composition, on the other hand, revealed to be quite decisive. Long-term experiments indicated that deactivation occurs independently of the lanthanide introduced into the ceria lattice and therefore oxygen mobility/reducibility of the catalysts does not play any role in improving the catalyst stability either. Catalyst reactivation was also investigated by applying different thermal treatments aiming at removing superficial deposits of carbonate complexes. The results led to the conclusion that the carbonate species play only a minor role in catalysts deactivation, suggesting that another factor, acting simultaneously as soon as reactant flux is started, determines the catalytic stability of such systems based on mixed oxides of ceria.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"description\": [\"doped with MeOx (Me=Zr, Sm, or La)\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"cubic\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"water\\u2013gas shift reaction\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pt\", \"description\": [\"deposited on CeO2\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"water\\u2013gas shift reaction\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MeOx (Me=Zr, Sm, or La)\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"cubic\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"ZrO2\", \"description\": [\"support\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"water\\u2013gas shift reaction\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

A high-temperature, high-pressure, pulsed-gas sampling and detection system has been developed for testing new catalytic and photocatalytic materials for the production of solar fuels. The reactor is fitted with a sapphire window to allow the irradiation of photocatalytic samples from a lamp or solar simulator light source. The reactor has a volume of only 3.80 ml allowing for the investigation of very small quantities of a catalytic material, down to 1 mg. The stainless steel construction allows the cell to be heated to 350 \u00b0C and can withstand pressures up to 27 bar, limited only by the sapphire window. High-pressure sampling is made possible by a computer controlled pulsed valve that delivers precise gas flow, enabling catalytic reactions to be monitored across a wide range of pressures. A residual gas analyser mass spectrometer forms a part of the detection system, which is able to provide a rapid, real-time analysis of the gas composition within the photocatalytic reaction chamber.

Load capacity of superconducting magnetic bearing was verified up to 10 kN in the static load test. After that, rotation test of that approximately 5 kN thrust load added was performed with maximum rotation of 3000rpm. In the results of bearing rotation test, it was confirmed that position in levitation is able to maintain with stability during the rotation. Heat transfer properties by radiation in vacuum and conductivity by tenuous gas were basically studied by experiment by the reason of confirmation of rotor cooling method. The experimental result demonstrates that the optimal gas pressure is able to obtain without generating windage drag.

We solve this optimization problem using a second-order model of battery charge dynamics, coupled with a physics-based model of battery aging via solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. Our optimization study focuses on a classical feedforward-feedback energy management policy, where feedforward control is used for peak shaving, and feedback is used for tracking a desired battery state of charge (SOC). Three feedforward-feedback architectures are examined: a proportional (P) control architecture, a proportional-integral (PI) architecture, and a PI architecture with a deadband in its feedforward path. We optimize these architectures\u2019 parameters using differential evolution, for real datacenter power demand histories. Our results show a significant Pareto tradeoff between dollar savings and battery longevity for all architectures. The introduction of a deadband furnishes a more attractive Pareto front by allowing the feedforward controller to focus on shaving larger peaks. Moreover, the use of integral control improves the robustness of the feedback policy to demand uncertainties and battery pack sizing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Recognition of Belousov-Zhabotinsky-type oscillations in autosynthetic micropyretic reactions\nMicropyretic synthesis is an autosynthesis route which requires minimal external energy. During synthesis, a high-temperature reaction front propagates in a uniform or unstable manner depending on the conditions chosen, thereby converting a reactant mix to the desired products accompanied by a large amount of entropy production. Sometimes banded microstructural features are noted to form (frozen into the final solid), often with a fixed periodicity. This banded structure is thought to be the signature of an oscillating wave front. In previous articles by us and others, banded structures and other residual instabilities have been thought to arise from variations in the combustion front velocity caused by a mismatch between the heat diffusion rate and the heat production rate from the product synthesis (i.e. from exceeding the critical Lewis number and related bifurcations). Such oscillations have been modeled in the past by a single overall reaction formulation and corresponding heat flow solution which we refer to as the extended Merzhanov model. Spiral fronts are also recognized in the literature. We believe now that banded structures could also arise from entropy generating, dissipative, Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) type reactions. Such reactions are discussed in this article. The overall BZ reaction progresses in the form of a nonlinear oscillator with several intermediary steady-state sub-reactionscontained in a reaction volume. We propose sub-reaction formulations by which a BZ reaction may occur during micropyretic synthesis. Micropyretic synthesis can display both types of oscillations, i.e. the Lewis type and the BZ type. We discuss materials systems where the BZ oscillations are possible, namely, the Ti-B and Ni-Al alloy systems. A comparison with experiments shows that the micropyretic product-chemistry is adequately predicted for the first time by a BZ formulation in both the Ti-B and several Ni-Al alloy systems. Wherever feasible compositional data reported in the literature are compared with the new predictions. It appears invoking the BZ yields a better picture of the final products.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

One of the obstacles to widespread industry adoption is the lack of profound understanding and the ability to monitor and control the long-term degradation and capacity fading observed in these systems. Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) serial sectioning is used to reconstruct the evolution of the three-dimensional structure of Li-ion battery electrodes during extended cycling. High resolution imaging reveals microstructural information at the level of the composite framework consisting of the spheroidal micro-particles of the active material held together by the polymer matrix. The evolution of damage within the micro-particles of the active material can be seen in the form of voiding, cracking and ultimate fragmentation. In particular, when spherical micro-particles of Li-rich layered oxides are used as the cathode, it is found that the extent of fragmentation varied in the direction of Li+ diffusion current from the particle surface inwards. We use a simple model of the strain and strain gradient effects of Li+ transient diffusion within the electrode to identify the driving force for particle fragmentation, and discuss the implication of these results.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

It was shown that ultraviolet irradiation leads to the appearance of the EPR spectrum near g = 2, which is similar to the spectrum observed upon gamma irradiation. The decomposition of the EPR spectra into components and the simulation of the shape of the experimental EPR signals revealed that these signals are associated primarily with two types of CO2\u2212 radicals, namely, the axial CO2\u2212 radicals and the orthorhombic CO2\u2212 radicals.

{"prompt": "On the abilities and limitations of the linear, exponential and combined models to describe the temperature dependence of the excess Gibbs energy of solutions\nIn this paper the performance of the linear, exponential and combined models to describe the temperature dependence of the excess Gibbs energy of solutions in the framework of the Redlich\u2013Kister model is discussed. The models are not compared to existing Calphad optimized databases, rather they are tested against the 209 binary solid and liquid metallic alloys, for which reliable experimental data exist on the heat of mixing and Gibbs energy of mixing in the handbook of Predel. It was found that the linear model often leads to high-T artifact (artificial inverted miscibility gaps) and the excess Gibbs energy approaches infinity at high temperatures, which seems unreasonable. It was also found that although both the exponential and combined models can in principle lead to low-T artifact (liquid re-stabilization), in real systems it probably does not take place, at least for the \u201cnormal\u201d systems (a system is \u201cnormal\u201d, if the heat of mixing, excess entropy of mixing and excess Gibbs energy of mixing have the same sign at the temperature of measurement; 86% of all systems are found \u201cnormal\u201d). The problem with the exponential model is that it is unable to describe the \u201cexceptional\u201d systems (14% of all systems). It is shown that the combined model is able to describe also these \u201cexceptional\u201d systems, as well. An algorithm is worked out to ensure that the combined model does not run into any high-T or low-T artifact, even when it is used to describe the \u201cexceptional\u201d systems. It is concluded that the T-dependence of the interaction energies for all solution phases described by the Redlich\u2013Kister polynomials should be described by the combined model. In this way an improved databank on excess Gibbs energies of solution phases can be gradually built, not leading to any artifact.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

Highly crystalline PB is prepared from Fe2O3 nanoparticles anchored on GO (Fe2O3/GO). Regulated Fe3+-ion release and slow crystallization with [Fe(CN)6] in the vicinity of Fe2O3/GO produce a GO-interconnected PB (HC-PB/GO) with fewer [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and H2O molecules.

{"prompt": "Implementation of Suitable Comfort Model for Posture and Motion Prediction in DHM Supported Vehicle Design\nDriver-vehicle interaction analyses are done to ensure a successful vehicle design from an ergonomics perspective. Digital Human Modelling (DHM) tools are often used to support such verifications, particularly at early stages of the product development process. When verifying that a vehicle design accommodates the diversity of users and tasks, a DHM tool needs to be able to represent postures and motions that are likely under certain conditions. This functionality is essential so that the tool user will obtain objective and repeatable simulation results. The DHM tool IMMA (Intelligently Moving Manikins) predicts postures and motions by using computational methods. This offers the possibility to generate postures and motions that are unique for the present design conditions. IMMA was originally developed for simulating manual assembly work, whereas the work presented here is a step towards utilizing the IMMA tool for occupant packaging and related tasks. The objective is a tool for virtual verification of driver-vehicle interaction that supports and automates the simulation work to a high degree. The prediction functionality in IMMA is based on the use of optimization algorithms where one important component is the consideration of comfort level.

{"prompt": "Application of the Transverse Thermoelectric Effects\nMost thermoelectric applications make use of the longitudinal Seebeck and Peltier effects. However, it is possible to produce thermoelectric effects in which the electrical and thermal flows are perpendicular to one another. This has certain practical advantages; for example, it makes possible the realization of an infinite-staged cascade refrigerator using a single piece of material. The benefits of separating the directions of the electrical and thermal currents have been demonstrated convincingly at low temperatures using the transverse thermomagnetic effects, but at ordinary temperatures the transverse thermoelectric effects are of more interest. These effects are to be found in any material in which the Seebeck coefficient is anisotropic. However, for them to be of practical value, a large and strongly anisotropic Seebeck coefficient must be combined with a high ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity. There is no known homogeneous substance in which this combination of properties is to be found. On the other hand, it is possible to obtain the required parameters in a synthetic material consisting of two phases.

First we show high performance in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), specifically a limiting situation in which the cell losses are ohmic in nature and derive from electrolyte conductance. Based on that case, we analyze the analogous limiting behavior of non-aqueous (NA) systems using a series of calculations assuming similar ohmic losses, scaled by the relative electrolyte resistances, with a higher voltage redox couple assumed for the NA battery. The results indicate that the NA battery performance is limited by the low electrolyte conductivity to a fraction of the performance of the VRFB.

{"prompt": "Exploring Mg-Zn-Ca-Based Bulk Metallic Glasses for Biomedical Applications Based on Thermodynamic Approach\nMagnesium (Mg)-based metallic glasses are considered as possible candidates in orthopedic implant applications. This paper aims to theoretically predict the glass-forming ability (GFA) in Mg-Zn-Ca alloy using a newly proposed thermodynamic model (PHHS), and the consistency of this model is verified through experimental analysis. PHHS is based on thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy of chemical mixing, elastic enthalpy, and configurational entropy, thus incorporating the pivotal effects, i.e., electron transfer effects, effect of atomic size mismatch, and effect of randomness, which aid to high GFA. In essence, PHHS can be visualized as the energy barrier that exists between the transformations of random atomic structure of glass to ordered crystalline structure. When the PHHS value is more negative, the energy barrier will be high, supporting easy glass formation. Various Mg-Zn-Ca metallic glass compositions displayed almost an expected and supporting trend, where the critical diameter of the metallic glass rod increased with a more negative PHHS value. Among the predicted Mg-Zn-Ca systems, the Mg60Zn35Ca5 composition shows deviation from the expected trend. This discrepancy has been clearly elucidated using a eutectic phase diagram. In addition to the consistency of the PHHS parameter to verifying the GFA of various compositions, the unique ability of this model is to predict unexplored Mg-Zn-Ca glass-forming compositions using contour development. Thus, proving PHHS parameter to be used as an efficient tool in predicting new glass-forming compositions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"metallic glass\", \"orthopedic implant\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Mg60Zn35Ca5\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"metallic glass\", \"orthopedic implant\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Mg-Zn-Ca\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"alloy\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

This review deals with the basic anodic stability of commonly-used electrolyte solutions for Li-ion batteries (mostly based on alkyl carbonate solvents). We discuss herein the surface chemistry of the following cathode materials: LiCoO2, V2O5, LiMn2O4, LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4, LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2, and LiFePO4. The methods applied included solution studies by ICP, Raman, X-ray photoelectron and FTIR spectroscopies, and electron microscopy, all in conjunction with electrochemical techniques. General phenomena are the possible dissolution of transition metal ions from these materials, which leads to changes in the active mass and a retardation in the electrode kinetics due to the formation of blocking surface films. These phenomena are significant mostly at elevated temperatures and in electrolyte solutions containing acidic species. Water-contaminated LiPF6 solutions can reach a high concentration of acidic species (e.g., HF), which is detrimental to the performance of materials such as LiCoO2 and LiFePO4. Both LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 and LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2, even when used as nanomaterials, show a high stability in commonly-used electrolyte solutions at high temperatures.

The influences of the composition of TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer on the interfacial structure, contact resistivity and interfacial thermal stability are investigated. The interfacial thermal stability is improved with increasing Si3N4 content in TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer due to the reduced mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion between the intermediate layer and SiGe. On the other hand, the contact resistivity increases with the rising of Si3N4 content due to the weakened TiB2/SiGe ohmic contact, which degrades the device efficiency. As the balanced point, the intermediate layer with the composition of 80vol% TiB2+20vol% Si3N4 provides good interfacial thermal stability and moderately small contact resistivity (~75\u03bc\u03a9cm2 after aging at 1000\u00b0C for 120h) simultaneously, which is an optimized intermediate layer composition for W\u2013Si3N4/TiB2\u2013Si3N4/p\u2013Si80Ge20B0.6 thermoelectric element. The TiB2\u2013Si3N4 intermediate layer has excellent chemical stability to both W\u2013Si3N4 electrode and SiGe thermoelectric material at high temperatures, which contributes to the sharp interface of the joint and effectively prevents the inter-diffusion between the electrode and the SiGe.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"electrode\", \"thermoelectric devices\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Si3N4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"composite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"intermediate layer\", \"thermoelectric devices\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"TiB2-Si3N4\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"composite\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"silicon germanium\", \"formula\": \"SiGe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"p-Ge20B0.6\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

Pure and doped solids were subjected to thermal treatment at 600 and 800\u00b0C prior to surface and catalytic measurements. The results showed that Co3O4-doping of CuO\u2013Al2O3 solids at 600\u00b0C caused a measurable increase in their specific surface area and the activity of CO oxidation. However, this treatment of solids calcined at 800\u00b0C brought about a marked decrease in their catalytic activity and specific surface area. This discrepancy is discussed in terms of the effect of Co3O4-doping in increasing the dispersity of CuO crystallites for solids calcined at 600\u00b0C and the role of Co3O4 in enhancing CuAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 formation upon heating at 800\u00b0C. The activity of pure CuO\u2013Al2O3 catalyst samples decreased progressively by regeneration while that of Co3O4 containing catalysts increased monotonically by regeneration to attain a high constant value after the fourth regeneration.

{"prompt": "Validation of a Thermal-Electric Li-Ion Battery Model\n\u00a9 2012 SAE International. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are investing substantial resources into the development and testing of advanced battery systems for the next generation of hybrid and electric vehicles. Likewise the US army is investing in lithium ion battery research for power and energy applications including SLI (starter, lights, and ignition), silent watch, unmanned vehicles, and directed energy weapons. A major design constraint is the management of the heat generated by Li-Ion battery systems. Extreme battery temperatures impact both the performance and reliability of the battery system as well as the overall operation of the vehicle. Analysis tools that can address vehicle and battery thermal management issues are needed to accelerate this development. To meet that need, a coupled thermal-electric model for battery cells and packs has been developed and implemented into the existing thermal modeling software RadTherm. This paper documents the comparison of physical test results with a computer model of the thermal response for an actual vehicle Li-Ion battery cell. The thermo-electrical battery model described in this paper predicts an effective driving potential and internal conductance for a cell based on the cell environmental temperature and measure of state of charge. From these parameters a local current density is computed and applied to an electrical model of the voltage distribution on the electrodes. Heat generation is derived from the local voltage difference across the electrodes and the current density between electrodes and then applied to a thermal model to predict local temperature rise over the cell. When applied to a cell, the battery model is useful for predicting the effects of cell size, tab location, and current collector thickness on voltage distribution and local heat generation. The model can also be applied to a multi-cell pack to study the effects of various thermal management strategies. In either application, battery loads corresponding to pre-determined drive cycles can be applied to the model to evaluate the ability of a particular cell or pack design to supply vehicle power in a given operating scenario. In this paper we describe the implementation of the model, compare model predictions to electrical and thermal measurements taken on a test cell, demonstrate the effects of different cell configurations on voltage and temperature distributions, and the show the relative effectiveness of various cooling schemes (natural and forced air convection and edge cooling) applied to a pack.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

When N2O and NO coexist in the gas phase, only noble metals are active near the light-off temperature, and the subsequent CO + N2O reaction is inhibited by the strong adsorption of NO. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"reduction of N2O\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pt-Rh\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"ceria-modified\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"reduction of N2O\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"\\u03b3-Al2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"reduction of N2O\"], \"name\": \"ceria\", \"formula\": \"CeO2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "The use of computer simulation in the evaluation of electric vehicle batteries\nAn integrated simulation and testing approach is presented to evaluate batteries for electric vehicle (EV) applications. This new approach combines traditional experimental testing with computer simulations to create a cost-effective means to evaluate EV batteries and provide important information that is difficult or impossible to obtain from purely experimental measurements. The present simulators for the lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries are developed based on the fundamental principles governing their electrochemical behaviors and are created using an advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Computer simulations are validated by experimental data under the dynamic stress test (DST) procedure for a lead-acid battery module and a Ni-MH cell with good agreement. Moreover, computer simulations reveal that the studied lead-acid battery underutilizes the active material by as much as 70% and the MH electrode of the Ni-MH cell is overdesigned by about 30% under the simulated EV duty. Therefore, there is good potential of increasing the specific energy and reducing the cost if batteries are optimized for EVs using a simulation-based design approach. \u00a9 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Here we present the detailed phase diagram of the layered P2-Na x VO 2 system determined from electrochemical intercalation/ deintercalation in sodium batteries and insitu X-ray diffraction experiments. It shows that four main single-phase domains exist within the 0.5\u2264x\u22640.9 range. During the sodium deintercalation (intercalation), they differ from one another in the sodium/vacancy ordering between the VO 2 slabs, which leads to commensurable or incommensurable superstructures. The electrochemical curve reveals that three peculiar compositions exhibit special structures for x = 1/2, 5/8 and 2/3. The detailed structural characterization of the P2-Na 1/2 VO 2 phase shows that the Na + ions are perfectly ordered to minimize Na + /Na + electrostatic repulsions.

{"prompt": "Coherent suppression of electromagnetic dissipation due to superconducting quasiparticles\nOwing to the low-loss propagation of electromagnetic signals in superconductors, Josephson junctions constitute ideal building blocks for quantum memories, amplifiers, detectors and high-speed processing units, operating over a wide band of microwave frequencies. Nevertheless, although transport in superconducting wires is perfectly lossless for direct current, transport of radio-frequency signals can be dissipative in the presence of quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap. Moreover, the exact mechanism of this dissipation in Josephson junctions has never been fully resolved experimentally. In particular, Josephson's key theoretical prediction that quasiparticle dissipation should vanish in transport through a junction when the phase difference across the junction is (ref. 2) has never been observed. This subtle effect can be understood as resulting from the destructive interference of two separate dissipative channels involving electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles. Here we report the experimental observation of this quantum coherent suppression of quasiparticle dissipation across a Josephson junction. As the average phase bias across the junction is swept through, we measure an increase of more than one order of magnitude in the energy relaxation time of a superconducting artificial atom. This striking suppression of dissipation, despite the presence of lossy quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap, provides a powerful tool for minimizing decoherence in quantum electronic systems and could be directly exploited in quantum information experiments with superconducting quantum bits. \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

{"prompt": "Mechanical Behaviors of a Cylindrical Superconducting Composite with Transport Current\nThe stress, displacement, and magnetostriction induced by flux pinning for a superconducting composite cylinder, which is consisted of two concentric shells with different critical current densities, are calculated analytically in the presence of transport current. Firstly, both the flux and current distributions are given for increasing and decreasing transport current cases by adopting the Bean model. Then the elastic solutions to stress, displacement and magnetostriction are obtained by using plane strain approach. Finally, lots of numerical results on these mechanical behaviors (including the cases of inner superconducting shell being replaced by an elastomer and/or by a hole) are displayed graphically and analyzed in detail. Numerical results show that, among others, during the transport current reduction, tensile stress especially radial tensile stress will occur in the outer region of the composite, and that in general, displacement is always negative in the superconducting composite with transport current. In addition, different to homogeneous superconducting cylinder, as the applied maximal transport current exceeds outer-cylinder critical current, the hysteresis loop of the magnetostriction exists for the full cycle of the transport current. Moreover, different to superconducting composite (including the case of the inner shell being an elastomer), the inner hole has significant effects on both the stress and displacement distributions of the outer superconducting shell, and for a hollow superconductor, the magnetostriction loop still exists even if the maximal transport current does not exceeds the its critical current.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Corrosion mechanism and hydrogen evolution on Mg\nMagnesium (Mg) dissolution is distinct from other engineering metals, as Mg can support cathodic hydrogen evolution on its surface during anodic polarisation. The phenomenon of cathodic hydrogen evolution upon anodically polarised Mg is characterised by the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) increasing with anodic polarisation, a phenomenon called the negative different effect (NDE). Mg has a tendency to aggressively corrode in aqueous solutions, impairing its application as a durable engineering material or a predictable electrode material, which is also influenced by the NDE. Over the last century a number of different theories have sought to explain the NDE. However, recent progress in research upon Mg utilising contemporary methods including advanced electrochemical techniques, on-line elemental analysis and cross-sectional electron microscopy, have not only refined the understanding of Mg dissolution, but discredited almost a century of alternate theories. During anodic polarisation, a bilayered MgO/Mg(OH)2 film forms on Mg, appearing as a dark region on visual inspection. This film gradually occupies the bulk of the previously pristine Mg surface, and importantly sustains (and enhances) the HER. This phenomenon of cathodic activation may also be catalysed by an enrichment of noble elements or impurities on the Mg surface, which could play an important role in promoting the HER. A phenomenological model for the dissolution of Mg encompassing the current opinion of many researchers is presented herein.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"hydrogen evolution reaction\"], \"name\": \"magnesium\", \"formula\": \"Mg\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"MgO\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"film\", \"corrosion product\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Mg(OH)2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"film\", \"corrosion product\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "The characteristics and stability of a dielectric elastomer spherical shell with a thick wall\nWhen a voltage is applied between the internal and external surface of a dielectric elastomer spherical shell, positive charges appear on one surface and negative charges on the other. This gives rise to Coulomb forces between opposite charges, generating a pressure. Thus, the shell reduces in thickness and stretches in area, and a higher electric field is produced. This positive feedback may make the shell continually thin down, eventually causing electrical instability. In this paper we use the neo-Hookean model and the Arruda-Boyce model to analyze the electromechanical instability of the thick-walled shell respectively. The electric field in the shell is inhomogeneous and varies with the radius of the shell. The instability in spherical shells with different thicknesses and boundary conditions is discussed. When the elastomer obeys the Arruda-Boyce model, the stability is related to the parameter n. The spherical shell will appear with snap-through instability and pull-in instability for different values of the parametern. \u00a9 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}
{"prompt": "Kinetics of Butane Oxidation by a Vanadyl Pyrophosphate Catalyst\nThe kinetics of butane oxidation by a vanadyl pyrophosphate (VPO) catalyst were analyzed from reduction transients using a novel oscillating microbalance reactor. The reduction rate of the equilibrated VPO catalyst with butane is 0.4th order in the butane concentration and 4th order in the available lattice oxygen concentration. This rate law is effective in representing the reduction of the catalyst to an extent equivalent to the removal of several layers of lattice oxygen. The activation energy for the reduction process is 85 kJ/mol, nearly the same as the apparent activation energy for the steady-state oxidation of butane on the VPO catalyst. These results suggest that the activation of butane is the rate-determining step for butane oxidation on VPO catalysts and that four surface oxygen ions may be involved in this step. The kinetics of VPO reduction by butane are useful in predicting the oxygen capacity of the catalyst and rate of butane oxidation under cyclic feed conditions, as in the circulating fluidized bed process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"vanadyl pyrophosphate\", \"formula\": \"VPO\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalyst\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Electronic origin of the high thermoelectric performance of GeTe among the p-type group IV monotellurides\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017. PbTe and SnTe in their p-type forms have long been considered high-performance thermoelectrics, and both of them largely rely on two valence bands (the first band at L point and the second one along the \u03a3 line) participating in the transport properties. This work focuses on the thermoelectric transport properties inherent to p-type GeTe, a member of the group IV monotellurides that is relatively less studied. Approximately 50 GeTe samples have been synthesized with different carrier concentrations spanning from 1 to 20 \u00d7 10 20 cm -3, enabling an insightful understanding of the electronic transport and a full carrier concentration optimization for the thermoelectric performance. When all of these three monotellurides (PbTe, SnTe and GeTe) are fully optimized in their p-type forms, GeTe shows the highest thermoelectric figure of merit (zT up to 1.8). This is due to its superior electronic performance, originating from the highly degenerated \u03a3 band at the band edge in the low-temperature rhombohedral phase and the smallest effective masses for both the L and \u03a3 bands in the high-temperature cubic phase. The high thermoelectric performance of GeTe that is induced by its unique electronic structure not only provides a reference substance for understanding existing research on GeTe but also opens new possibilities for the further improvement of the thermoelectric performance of this material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"GeTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"rhombohedral\", \"cubic\"], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"PbTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"thermoelectric\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnTe\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"p-type\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Hexagonal plaquette spin-spin interactions and quantum magnetism in a two-dimensional ion crystal\n\u00a9 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. We propose a trapped ion scheme en route to realize spin Hamiltonians on a Kagome lattice which, at low energies, are described by emergent \u211d2 gauge fields, and support a topological quantum spin liquid ground state. The enabling element in our scheme is the hexagonal plaquette spin-spin interactions in a two-dimensional ion crystal. For this, the phonon-mode spectrum of the crystal is engineered by standing-wave optical potentials or by using Rydberg excited ions, thus generating localized phonon-modes around a hexagon of ions selected out of the entire two-dimensional crystal. These tailored modes can mediate spin-spin interactions between ion-qubits on a hexagonal plaquette when subject to state-dependent optical dipole forces. We discuss how these interactions can be employed to emulate a generalized Balents-Fisher-Girvin model in minimal instances of one and two plaquettes. This model is an archetypical Hamiltonian in which gauge fields are the emergent degrees of freedom on top of the classical ground state manifold. Under realistic situations, we show the emergence of a discrete Gauss's law as well as the dynamics of a deconfined charge excitation on a gauge-invariant background using the two-plaquettes trapped ions spin-system. The proposed scheme in principle allows further scaling in a future trapped ion quantum simulator, and we conclude that our work will pave the way towards the simulation of emergent gauge theories and quantum spin liquids in trapped ion systems.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

The ceria\u2013zirconia mixed oxide is itself an active catalyst for methane combustion, in the 673\u20131073 K temperature range. Deposition of platinum or palladium on this support results in a strong increase in activity, which now takes place at low temperature (473\u2013773 K). The ceria\u2013zirconia support is particularly beneficial for the activity of platinum, when compared to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Methane oxidation takes place at the active ceria\u2013zirconia/metal interface, according to a redox mechanism involving the reaction of dissociated methane with lattice oxygen from the support. However, a time-on-stream deactivation is observed at moderate temperatures (573\u2013623 K), which is associated with an oxidized state of the catalysts, whereas a reduction at 573 K strongly activates the solids. In situ electrical conductivity measurements show that the reduction at 573 K of the Pt/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 and Pd/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 catalysts creates a large amount of oxygen vacancies. Although the reduced ceria\u2013zirconia support is largely reoxidized by oxygen at 573 K, some vacancies still remain and require a higher oxidation temperature (773 K) to be filled. The presence of vacancies, even in small amounts, seems to favor activity because of an electron transfer to the noble metals and an improvement of the lattice oxygen mobility. The slow filling of these vacancies is probably an important factor contributing to the observed time-on-stream deactivation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Ce0.67Zr0.33O2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"solid solution\", \"support\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"platinum\", \"formula\": \"Pt\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"deposited on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"palladium\", \"formula\": \"Pd\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"deposited on Ce0.67Zr0.33O2\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"catalyst\", \"methane total oxidation\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Pt/Al2O3\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "GHG Emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles in China\n\u00a9 2017 by the authors. With the mass market penetration of electric vehicles, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with lithium-ion battery production has become a major concern. In this study, by establishing a life cycle assessment framework, GHG emissions from the production of lithium-ion batteries in China are estimated. The results show that for the three types of most commonly used lithium-ion batteries, the (LFP) battery, the (NMC) battery and the (LMO) battery, the GHG emissions from the production of a 28 kWh battery are 3061 kgCO2-eq, 2912 kgCO2-eq and 2705 kgCO2-eq, respectively. This implies around a 30% increase in GHG emissions from vehicle production compared with conventional vehicles. The productions of cathode materials and wrought aluminum are the dominating contributors of GHG emissions, together accounting for around three quarters of total emissions. From the perspective of process energy use, around 40% of total emissions are associated with electricity use, for which the GHG emissions in China are over two times higher than the level in the United States. According to our analysis, it is recommended that great efforts are needed to reduce the GHG emissions from battery production in China, with improving the production of cathodes as the essential measure.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Solid-state contributions to densification during liquid-phase sintering\nDensification via liquid-phase sintering generally requires transport of substantial amounts of dissolved solid through the liquid. However, in composite systems, such as W-Cu, solid solubility in the liquid is almost negligible, and densification is hindered by the low amount of total mass transport. In this case, solid-state sintering of the skeletal solid structure in the presence of the liquid is a significant densification mechanism. In this article, the relative contributions to densification of both liquid and solid mass transport mechanisms are considered. A computer simulation is constructed to predict the densification behavior and concurrent microstructural development of liquidphase sintered composites for realistic heating cycles. Governing differential equations for densification are derived from idealized models of the microstructure, considering grain size, diffusion distance from vacancy source to sink, pore size, and pore morphology. Temperature-dependent terms, including the diffusivity, solubility, and surface energy, govern densification and microstructural parameters, such as the grain size, dihedral angle, and contiguity. Predictions for the sintered density, grain size, and contiguity are compared to experimental results for the W-Cu and W-Cu-Ni systems with approximately 20 vol pct liquid. For W-Cu, which has almost no intersolubility, solid-state sintering of W in the presence of liquid Cu is the dominant densification mechanism. Nickel additions increase solid solubility in the liquid and improve typical liquid-phase sintering contributions to densification. Alternatively, high sintered densities can be achieved in the absence of solubility with a sufficiently small particle size due to the solid-state contribution.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Cu\", \"description\": [\"composite system\", \"sintered\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"W-Cu-Ni\", \"description\": [\"composite system\", \"sintered\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"Cu\", \"description\": [\"\"], \"acronym\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"liquid\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Structural Studies of Polymers with Hydrophilic Spacer Groups: Infrared Spectroscopy of Langmuir\u2014Blodgett Multilayers of Preformed Polymers with Hydrocarbon Side Chains\nA series of preformed polymers containing amphiphilic side chains and hydrophilic spacer groups in the backbone have been investigated by grazing incidence reflection and transmission infrared spectroscopy. In the former the electric field vector is normal to the film surface whereas in the latter, it is parallel to the surface. The two measurements taken collectively have provided information about the orientation of the ordered amphiphilic side groups and the partially disordered polymer backbone. The results indicate that there is a definite preferred orientation of the side chain axis normal to the substrate surface. The extent of this side chain order is affected by both the concentration of backbone spacer groups and the temperature of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) layers.

Processing can change these features: repeated cycling can \u201ctrain\u201d the reverse shape memory effect, while changing the amount of hysteresis and other functional properties.

The simulations show transformations in this model material proceed by non-diffusive nucleation and growth processes and produce distinct microstructures. We observe the generation of persistent lattice defects during forward-and-reverse transformations which serve as nucleation centres in subsequent transformation processes. These defects interfere the temporal and spatial progression of transformations and thereby affect subsequent product morphologies. During cyclic transformations we observe accumulations of lattice defects so as to establish new microstructural elements which represent a memory of the previous morphologies.

In the present work, various types of solid state reactivity in solid oxide fuel cells and particularly in systems with zirconia electrolyte and oxide cathodes are addressed. Examples of solid state reactivity induced modifications of bulk, interface and surface chemistry in the SOFC cathode are discussed and correlated with its electrochemical performance. The formation of pyrochlore is considered as example of solid state reactions that occur in zirconia\u2013manganite and zirconia\u2013cobaltite cathodes. Possible reaction mechanisms and their contributions are discussed for various perovskites and different geometries. The local interface chemistry and electronic structure in zirconia\u2013manganite cathodes are studied by ELNES. Differences between annealed and operated cathodes reveal that upon SOFC operation (cathode polarization) a highly defective structure with high concentrations of partially reduced transition metal develops at the interfaces.

The influence of cathode and electrolyte surface chemistry on SOFC performance is illustrated in several examples that include electrochemical promotion, cathode poisoning by silicates and by chromium oxide.

Battery energy density, effective capacitance, and efficiency were investigated as a function of current load or depth of discharge, cycle rate, and end of discharge voltage. Energy densities of nearly 165 J/kg were demonstrated when used as a capacitor. Current loads of up to a 100 C-rate were demonstrated and a peak effective capacitance of 0.19 F/cm2 of frontal area was achieved. Cadmium electrode morphology was photographed and studied as a function of the charge and discharge cycle life with no crystalline anomalies discovered. Nickel electrode variability caused individual cell voltage imbalances and were a prime problem area. \u00a9 1986, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

{"prompt": "Laser surface forming of AlCoCrCuFeNi particle reinforced AZ91D matrix composites\nTraditionally, the laser melt injection (LMI) technique can only be used for forming ceramic particles reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) for enhancing surface properties of lightweight engineering materials. In this research, the LMI method was employed to form metal particles reinforced MMCs on AZ91D instead. This was viable because of the unique properties of the AlCoCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) metal particles used. The large difference in melting point between the HEA and the substrate material (AZ91D), and the limited reaction and the lack of fusion between the HEA and Mg have made it possible that a metal particles reinforced AZ91D composite material was produced. The reason of limited reaction was considered mainly due to the relatively high mixing enthalpy between the HEA constituent elements and Mg. Although there was some melting occurred at the particles surface with some solute segregation found in the vicinity close to the surface, intermetallic compounds were not observed. With regard to the wear resistance of the MMCs, it was found that when the volume fraction of the reinforcement phase, i.e. the HEA particles, reached about 0.4, the wear volume loss of the coating was only one-seventh of that of the substrate material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"AZ91D\", \"applications\": [\"metal matrix composites\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"matrix\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"high-entropy alloy\", \"metal matrix composites\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"AlCoCrCuFeNi\", \"structure_or_phase\": [], \"description\": [\"particles\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

In this work, first principles calculations have been carried out to analyze the structural stability and to determine the electric, elastic and thermodynamic properties of AlY2 as a function of pressure from 0 to 50GPa with a step 5GPa.

{"prompt": "Dynamic mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems in residential buildings\nBattery energy storage devices coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems have to react to the fluctuating nature of the PV output and electrical demand in residential buildings. However, the charging and discharging power cannot be adjusted to the power fluctuations without any time delay so that an inherent temporal mismatch between the battery power and the residual power (PV output minus load) occurs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a simulation study analyzing the response time-induced mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems. Firstly, the response time issue is analyzed theoretically to reveal how the energy flows between the household and the grid are changed due to the delayed battery response. Then, measurements are presented to show the dynamic behavior of two different PV-battery systems. The experimental results reveal settling times of up to 7 s to reach the steady state after an abrupt step change in the load demand. Thirdly, simulations of an AC-coupled PV-battery system are carried out with a time step size of 1 s. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the impact of the dynamic response on the annual amount of energy exchanged with the grid. It is found that longer response times are accomplished by an increase in the grid feed-in and grid supply as well. Consequently, a slow-reacting battery system diminishes the economic benefit for the owner of the PV-battery system. In order to improve the transparency from the end-custome\u0155s point of view, response time-related specifications should be stated in the data sheets of the products in the future.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

The flow to these quantum critical points is tuned by doping, substitution and anisotropy. It is shown that the empirical correlations, like the dependence of Tc on dopant and substitution concentration, the dependence of Tc on zero temperature in-plane penetration depth, etc., reflect universal properties associated with the flow to these quantum critical points, and of the crossover from one to the other. A detailed account of the flow to 2D-QSI and 3D-QSN criticality is a challenge for microscopic theories attempting to solve the puzzle of superconductivity in these materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

The electrochemical measurements show that mesoporous CuCo2O4 possess higher oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution activity than bulk CuCo2O4 both in alkaline and non-aqueous solution.

For H2O, reaction order changed from 0.6 to zero at the stoichiometric, n-butane\u2009:\u2009H2O ratio.

Instead of the critical state model, we suggest another primitive model which is able to describe the magnetic properties of an intergranular system.

{"prompt": "Temperature factor for magnetic instability conditions of type \u2013 II superconductors\nThe macroscopic development of interrelated electrodynamics and thermal states taking place both before and after instability onset in type-II superconductors are studied using the critical state and the flux creep concepts. The physical mechanisms of the non-isothermal formation of the critical state are discussed solving the set of unsteady thermo-electrodynamics equations taking into consideration the unknown moving penetration boundary of the magnetic flux. To make it, the numerical method, which allows to study diffusion phenomena with unknown moving phase-two boundary, is developed. The corresponding non-isothermal flux jump criteria are written. It is proved for the first time that, first, the diffusion phenomena in superconductors have the fission-chain-reaction nature, second, the stability conditions, losses in superconductor and its stable overheating before instability onset are mutually dependent. The results are compared with those following from the existing magnetic instability theory, which does not take into consideration the stable temperature increase of superconductor before the instability onset. It is shown that errors of isothermal approximation are significant for modes closed to adiabatic ones. Therefore, the well-known adiabatic flux jump criterion limits the range of possible stable superconducting states since a correct determination of their stability states must take into account the thermal prehistory of the stable magnetic flux penetration. As a result, the calculation errors in the isothermal approximation will rise when the sweep rate of an external magnetic field or the size of the superconductor\u2019s cross-sectional area increase. The basic conclusions formulated in the framework of the critical state model are verified comparing the experimental results and the numerical analysis of the stability conditions and the temperature dynamics of the helicoid-type superconducting current-carrying element having real voltage\u2013current characteristic. On the whole, the non-isothermal stability conditions expand the existence of allowable stable superconducting states.

{"prompt": "The formation of disilicides from bilayers of Ni/Co and Co/Ni on silicon: Phase separation and solid solution\nBilayers of Ni/Co and Co/Ni were deposited onto silicon by means of electron beam evaporation. The annealing behavior was investigated as a function of time in the temperature range 475\u2013550 \u00b0C by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Auger electron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray analysis. In this temperature range it is observed that the disilicide (solid solution) nucleates and grows from a film containing both the monosilicide of cobalt and that of nickel. These nearly insoluble monosilicides are separated into layers; the disilicide grows from the interface between the NiSi and the CoSi phase. If there are equal amounts of the two metals this interface is located approximately midway between the upper surface and the silicon substrate. The disilicide grows simultaneously both toward the free surface and toward the silicon substrate. The growth kinetics of the disilicide have been analyzed and are found to be complex. The general behavior of the disilicide formation is found to be similar to that found for Co-Ni alloy films and as for the latter case indicates the primacy of nucleation over diffusion as the controlling mechanism in the disilicide formation. The site of nucleation of the disilicide at the NiSi-CoSi interface is explained by a model based on (a) the phase separation of the two monosilicides and (b) the high entropy of mixing of the mixed disilicide. In agreement with this model the nucleation of the mixed disilicides is shown to occur at temperatures much lower than those for either CoSi2 or NiSi2. Given the common crystal structure and the almost identical lattice parameters, the mutual solubilities of CoSi2 and NiSi2 follow from elementary concepts of alloy phase theory.

(Figure Presented) Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have lately received considerable attention as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries because sodium resources are essentially inexhaustible and ubiquitous around the world. Despite recent reports on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries have shown electrochemical activities close to their lithium-ion counterparts, the major scientific challenge for sodium-ion batteries is to exploit efficient anode materials. Herein, we demonstrate that a hybrid material composed of few-layer SnS 2 nanosheets sandwiched between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets exhibits a high specific capacity of 843 mAh g -1 (calculated based on the mass of SnS 2 only) at a current density of 0.1 A g -1 and a 98% capacity retention after 100 cycles when evaluated between 0.01 and 2.5 V. Employing ex situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction techniques, we illustrate the high specific capacity of our anode through a 3-fold mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the ab-plane of SnS 2 nanosheets and the subsequent formation of Na 2 S 2 and Na 15 Sn 4 through conversion and alloy reactions. The existence of RGO nanosheets in the hybrid material functions as a flexible backbone and high-speed electronic pathways, guaranteeing that an appropriate resilient space buffers the anisotropic dilation of SnS 2 nanosheets along the ab-plane and c-axis for stable cycling performance.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"\", \"formula\": \"SnS2\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\"]}, {\"acronym\": \"\", \"applications\": [\"sodium-ion batteries\", \"anode\"], \"name\": \"reduced graphene oxide\", \"formula\": \"\", \"structure_or_phase\": [\"\"], \"description\": [\"nanosheets\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n"}

{"prompt": "Optimization method for the design of hexagonal fuel assemblies\nThe duct wall and inter-assembly gap make up \u223c5\u201315% of the volume of a typical fast reactor core and these components have a profound impact on the system neutron economy.

For each nuclear reactor core made up of ducted assemblies there exists a unique optimum solution of duct wall thickness and inter-assembly gap, where these components have the minimum impact on the core neutron balance while adhering to applicable structural constraints. The assembly duct wall must maintain its structural integrity and intended function while being exposed to a harsh environment of pressure, temperature and neutron fluence causing elastic and inelastic deflections and swelling. Analytical expressions, applicable to any internally pressurized hexagonal structure, were defined for the peak stress and elastic wall deflection. Detailed analysis of fuel assembly duct designs requires finite element code analysis, radial bowing analysis codes and the full temperature, flux and stress distribution over the lifetime of the assembly in the core to accurately estimate creep deformation.

{"prompt": "Phase field model for coupled displacive and diffusive microstructural processes under thermal loading\nA non-isothermal phase field model that captures both displacive and diffusive phase transformations in a unified framework is presented. The model is developed in a formal thermodynamic setting, which provides guidance on admissible constitutive relationships and on the coupling of the numerous physical processes that are active. Phase changes are driven by temperature-dependent free-energy functions that become non-convex below a transition temperature. Higher-order spatial gradients are present in the model to account for phase boundary energy, and these terms necessitate the introduction of non-standard terms in the energy balance equation in order to satisfy the classical entropy inequality point-wise. To solve the resulting balance equations, a Galerkin finite element scheme is elaborated. To deal rigorously with the presence of high-order spatial derivatives associated with surface energies at phase boundaries in both the momentum and mass balance equations, some novel numerical approaches are used. Numerical examples are presented that consider boundary cooling of a domain at different rates, and these results demonstrate that the model can qualitatively reproduce the evolution of microstructural features that are observed in some alloys, especially steels. The proposed model opens a number of interesting possibilities for simulating and controlling microstructure pattern development under combinations of thermal and mechanical loading.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " []\n\nEND\n\n"}

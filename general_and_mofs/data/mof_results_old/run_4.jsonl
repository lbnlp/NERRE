{"prompt": "Chemically functionalized 3D reticular graphene oxide frameworks decorated with MOF-derived Co3O4: Towards highly sensitive and selective detection to acetone\nHere, we have newly developed chemically functionalized three-dimension (3D) graphene oxide hydrogels (FGH) decorated with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived Co3O4 nanostructures, in which the Co3O4 nanostructures are uniformly distributed in 3D FGH frameworks. It is found that the Co3O4/FGH composites exhibits excellent acetone sensing properties, for instance, it shows an ultra-high response (Rgas/R0 = 81.2) to 50 ppm acetone, which was \u223c20 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4 film, a short response time (\u223c20 s), and a distinct cross-selectivity against other interfering gases. Notably, upon exposure to 1 ppm acetone in air, the composites still can express an apparent response (Rgas/R0 = 4.06). The excellent acetone sensing properties of Co3O4/FGH can be mainly attributed to the unique porous structures of 3D FGH frameworks and the modulation of electrical transport properties of the Co3O4/FGH junctions in the composites. The Co3O4 nanostructures uniformly distributed in 3D FGH frameworks can easily adsorb a great amount of acetone gas molecules through the unique porous frameworks and produce a great deal of electrons, which can be transferred to the p-type FGH frameworks through Co3O4/FGH junctions so that the resistance of Co3O4/FGH composites is greatly increased. Therefore, the acetone response of the composites is dramatically enhanced because of the Co3O4/FGH junctions. This study presents a new idea of building MOF-derived oxides/FGH junctions to enhance gas response of oxide-based gas sensors, and has great potential in fabrication of new generation gas sensors.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived Co3O4 nanostructures\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sensors\", \"sensing\", \"detection to acetone\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sensors\", \"detection to acetone\", \"sensing properties\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "The effects of framework dynamics on the behavior of water adsorbed in the [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] and Co-MOF-74 metal\u2013organic frameworks\nThe effects of framework flexibility on the structural and dynamical properties of water adsorbed in two prototypical metal\u2013organic frameworks are investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that water molecules in the pores of a flexible model of [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] exhibit slower dynamics than when the framework is artificially held rigid in the simulations. In contrast, the water dynamics in Co-MOF-74 is predicted to be accelerated by the framework vibrations. The origin of this different behavior directly relates to how water interacts with the two frameworks, which, in turn, determines different hydrogen-bond patterns in the pores. While the first water molecules adsorbed in [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] donate a single hydrogen bond to the Zn\u2013Cl groups and point the other hydrogen atom towards the center of the pore, water molecules adsorbed in Co-MOF-74 initially bind to the cobalt atoms of the framework via their oxygen atoms, thus leaving each molecule free to form two hydrogen bonds with additional molecules adsorbed at higher loading.

The development of porous well-defined hybrid materials (e.g., metal-organic frameworks or MOFs) will add a new dimension to a wide number of applications ranging from supercapacitors and electrodes to \"smart\" membranes and thermoelectrics. From this perspective, the understanding and tailoring of the electronic properties of MOFs are key fundamental challenges that could unlock the full potential of these materials. In this work, we focused on the fundamental insights responsible for the electronic properties of three distinct classes of bimetallic systems, M x-y M\u2032 y -MOFs, M x M\u2032 y -MOFs, and M x (ligand-M\u2032 y )-MOFs, in which the second metal (M\u2032) incorporation occurs through (i) metal (M) replacement in the framework nodes (type I), (ii) metal node extension (type II), and (iii) metal coordination to the organic ligand (type III), respectively. We employed microwave conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, pressed-pellet conductivity, and theoretical modeling to shed light on the key factors responsible for the tunability of MOF electronic structures. Experimental prescreening of MOFs was performed based on changes in the density of electronic states near the Fermi edge, which was used as a starting point for further selection of suitable MOFs. As a result, we demonstrated that the tailoring of MOF electronic properties could be performed as a function of metal node engineering, framework topology, and/or the presence of unsaturated metal sites while preserving framework porosity and structural integrity.

{"prompt": "How Does CO2 React with Styrene Oxide in Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74? Catalytic Mechanisms Proposed by QM/MM Calculations\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. We report a QM/MM computational study of the cycloaddition between carbon dioxide (CO2) and styrene oxide in two different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Co-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74, to obtain atomic-level insights into the catalytic mechanism. The results suggest that both reactions begin by forming Lewis acid-base pairs between the epoxide and an open metal site and between CO2 and a phenolate moiety in the linker. Consequently, higher electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivities are conferred on the epoxide and CO2 (CO2(A)), respectively, thereby facilitating the initial ring-opening of the epoxide moiety. The ring-opening process is followed by the adsorption of a second CO2 molecule (CO2(B)), which is necessary for the subsequent ring closure to occur. In the case of Co-MOF-74, the binding of CO2(B) to the alkoxide oxygen increases the flexibility of the substrate moiety, enabling the cyclization pathway in which CO2(A) is incorporated into the final product.

Further work needs to study the sensor\u2019s performance in non-dry gas streams at different levels of humidity and its integration with different materials to address the practical challenges, and to improve the selectivity of the sensor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"sensor\", \"gas monitoring\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"sensor\", \"gas monitoring\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"sensor\", \"gas monitoring\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Size-matching ligand insertion in MOF-74 for enhanced CO2 capture under humid conditions\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. Among various class of materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising candidates for CO2 capture from flue gases. In particular, M-MOF-74, where M represents different metals, are equipped with open metal sites that can lead to very high CO2 uptake at postcombustion flue gas conditions. However, these structures are known to have poor CO2 capture performance under humid conditions as water molecules bind strongly to the unsaturated metal sites, outcompeting the CO2. In this computational study, a pore space partition strategy is employed through a symmetry-matching regulated ligand insertion within the Mg-MOF-74 and Zn-MOF-74 structures, which mitigates the deterioration effect of water. In the case of Zn-MOF-74, higher selectivity as well as larger CO2 uptake in binary mixture conditions is obtained, thereby demonstrating that reduction in the pore size of MOFs can serve as viable strategy to capture CO2 under humid postcombustion conditions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"M-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"humid conditions\", \"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"humid conditions\", \"CO2 uptake\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"M-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"CO2 capture from flue gases\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"CO2 capture from flue gases\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Structural characterization, optical properties and photocatalytic activity of MOF-5 and its hydrolysis products: Implications on their excitation mechanism\n\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry. The existing concerns on the limited stability of Zn4O-based MOFs upon exposure to humidity or aqueous environments, as well as on the excitation mechanisms, are discussed on the basis of Raman, FTIR, DR-UV and XRD measurements. This paper demonstrates that MOF-5 dispersed in water produces a relatively stable new phase, MOF-5W, which slowly degrades to MOF-5H, a mixture of MOF-5W and zinc terephthalate dihydrate (ZTDH). The structure and optical properties of MOF-5W and MOF-5H and their optical and photocatalytic properties reveal the main role played by the organic moiety in determining the final properties of these structures, supporting the idea of a ligand to ligand charge transfer (LLCT) excitation mechanism rather than the usually assumed ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zn4O-based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic activity\", \"excitation mechanism\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5W\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic activity\", \"excitation mechanism\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5H\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic activity\", \"excitation mechanism\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zn4O-based MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic\", \"excitation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5W\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic\", \"excitation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5H\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic\", \"excitation\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Efficient multicolor and white light emission from Zr-based MOF composites: spectral and dynamic properties\nWe report on the spectroscopy and dynamics of a Zr-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid (Zr-NDC) MOF interacting with three laser dyes: Coumarin 153 (C153), Nile Red (NR) and 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) in diethyl ether (DE) suspensions. The photoexcitation of the MOF forming the composites (dyes@MOF) leads to an energy transfer (ET) to the trapped dyes, opening the door to tune the material emission. Trapped C153 molecules exhibit two different ET dynamics. At lower C153 concentrations, the mean ET time process (from MOF monomers) is \u223c3.3 ns, whereas at higher ones it is \u223c360 ps. These mean ET times, which are guest-concentration dependent, reflect the different dye occupancies in the MOF pores. For trapped NR and DCM molecules, because of a different emission (energy donor) and absorption (energy acceptor) spectral overlap, the ET takes place from the excimers and not from the monomers. Solvent suspensions of the Zr-NDC MOF trapping these three dyes show multicolor and white light emission, having quantum yields of up to 41%. More specifically, NR/C153@Zr-NDC in diethyl ether suspension gives three emission bands having their intensity maxima at \u223c385, \u223c500 and \u223c660 nm. This combination produces a white light, having CIE coordinates (0.32, 0.34) very close to the ideal ones (0.33, 0.33).

{"prompt": "Enhanced permeation arising from dual transport pathways in hybrid polymer\u2013MOF membranes\nThe rise of anthropogenic global warming has sparked new interest in developing strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Conventional carbon capture processes are not economically viable at scale due to their enormous energy cost. Membrane-based separation is a promising alternative, but its separation performance has traditionally been limited by a well-known trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Here, we report a hybrid polymer/inorganic membrane with dual transport pathways, which allows us to overcome this traditional limitation. The inorganic phase consists of a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), which is an ideal inorganic dispersant to construct dual transport pathways as the crystalline porous structure of MOFs is more amenable to molecular diffusion than polymers. Previous hybrid membrane research has failed to achieve sufficiently high loadings to establish a percolative network necessary for dual transport, often due to mechanical failure of the membrane at high loading. Using polysulfone and UiO-66-NH2 MOF as a model system, we achieve high MOF loadings (50 wt%) and observe the evolution from single mode to dual transport regimes. The newly formed percolative pathway through the MOF, which has not previously been observed, acts as a molecular highway for gases. As the MOF loading increases to 30 wt%, CO2 permeability increases linearly from 5.6 barrers in polysulfone homopolymer to 18 barrers. Crucially, between 30 and 40 wt%, a percolative MOF network arises and the CO2 permeability dramatically rises from 18 to 46 barrers; an eight-fold increase over pure polysulfone, while maintaining selectivity over methane and nitrogen near the pure polymer at 24 and 26, respectively. A similar phenomenon is observed in the measurement of the diffusion coefficient and is consistent with the formation of dual transport pathways. The findings in this study enable new approaches towards designing hybrid membranes with dual transport pathways. This is an important step towards a competitive membrane-based carbon capture process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"separation\"]}]"}

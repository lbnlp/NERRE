{"prompt": "A facile and general coating approach to moisture/water-resistant metal-organic frameworks with intact porosity\n\u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society. The moisture sensitivity of many metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) poses a critical issue for their large-scale real application. One of the most effective methods to solve this problem is to convert the surface of MOFs from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Herein, we develop a general strategy to modify hydrophobic polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) on the surface of MOF materials to significantly enhance their moisture or water resistance by a facile vapor deposition technique. MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZnBT as representative vulnerable MOFs were successfully coated by PDMS, and these coated samples well inherited their original crystalline nature and pore characteristics. Strikingly, the surface areas of these MOFs were nearly 100% retained upon PDMS-coating. Such a coating process might render MOFs applicable in the presence of water or humidity in extended fields such as gas sorption and catalysis.\n\n###\n\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\", \"catalysis\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\", \"catalysis\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZnBT\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\", \"catalysis\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\", \"catalysis\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\", \"catalysis\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZnBT\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas sorption\", \"catalysis\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Synthesis and characterizations of metal-free Semiconductor/MOFs with good stability and high photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution: A novel Z-Scheme heterostructured photocatalyst formed by covalent bonds\nTo solve serious energy and environmental crises caused by rapid industrial development, the formation of Z-scheme heterostructured photocatalysts is a promising approach for efficient and scalable H2 production from water splitting due to wide absorption range, high charge-separation efficiency and strong redox ability of the Z-scheme heterostructured photocatalysts. In this study, we combined the MOFs of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with g-C3N4 functionalized by benzoic acid (CFB) to synthesize a novel composite catalyst of CFB/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (CFBM) by covalent bonds for the first time. The benzoic acid in the CFBM acts as electron mediator to well separate photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to excellent photocatalytic performance of photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting under visible light irradiation. Experimental results show that the H2 production rate of the 10CFBM is 1.123mmol\u00b7h\u22121\u00b7g\u22121, which is about 6 times of the NH2-MIL-125(Ti). Meanwhile, the simple physical mixture of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with 10wt% g-C3N4 and the 10wt%g-C3N4/MOFs heterostructured catalyst all show much smaller H2 evolution rate and worse stability than that of the 10CFBM. Finally, we proposed a possible mechanism to well explain the improved photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system based on the results of different characterizations. The present work gives a good example to develop a novel Z-scheme heterostructured system with good stability and high photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution and puts forward a new synthetic strategy to prepare metal-free semiconductor/MOFs formed by covalent bonds.\n\n###\n\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-125(Ti)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Semiconductor\", \"photocatalytic\", \"H2 evolution\", \"water splitting\", \"photocatalytic hydrogen generation\", \"semiconductor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CFB/NH2-MIL-125(Ti)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Semiconductor\", \"photocatalytic\", \"H2 evolution\", \"water splitting\", \"photocatalytic hydrogen generation\", \"semiconductor\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-125(Ti)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic hydrogen generation\", \"H2 evolution\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CFB/NH2-MIL-125(Ti)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic hydrogen generation\", \"H2 evolution\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"10CFBM\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic hydrogen generation\", \"H2 evolution\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"10wt%g-C3N4/MOFs\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalytic hydrogen generation\", \"H2 evolution\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Hydrogen adsorption on metal-organic framework (MOF-5) synthesized by DMF approach\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), especially MOF-5, are believed to be promising new porous materials for hydrogen adsorption. A comparative study of material synthesis, characterization and hydrogen adsorption was performed to examine the effects of different synthesis conditions on crystal structure, pore textural property and hydrogen adsorption performance of MOF-5 materials. Three MOF-5 samples synthesized with dimethyl formamide (DFM) as solvent and slightly different procedures have shown similar phase structure and chemical composition, diverse crystal structures, varying pore textural properties and different hydrogen adsorption performance. It was established from the experimental results that higher order of crystallinity in the MOF-5 materials generates better adsorbents with larger crystal size, higher specific surface area, uniform pore size distribution (PSD), larger hydrogen adsorption capacity and faster hydrogen diffusion rate in MOF-5 adsorbents. The best MOF-5 sample synthesized in this work (MOF-5(\u03b3)) has a Langmuir specific surface area of 1157 m2/g; it can adsorb 0.5\u00a0wt.% of hydrogen at 77\u00a0K and 800\u00a0mmHg; and results in hydrogen diffusivity inside MOF-5 crystal of 2.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0cm2/s.

{"prompt": "Upgrading of palmitic acid over MOF catalysts in supercritical fluid of n-hexane\n\u00a9 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.  The addition of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) to the synthesis mixture of PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5 yields the direct encapsulation of PTA inside the MOF structure (i.e. PTA@PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5) through a facile solvothermal approach. The deoxygenation reaction of palmitic acid has been investigated over PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5 and PTA@PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5 under a hydrogen atmosphere in the supercritical fluid (SCF) of n-hexane. The results showed that palmitic acid can be converted completely at 240 \u00b0C on PTA@PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5 with a high selectivity of hexadecane. Owning to the improvement of acidity of the MOF catalyst by the encapsulation of PTA inside the hollow octahedral nanostructures of PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5, the selectivity for hexadecane over the PTA@PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5 catalyst is higher than that over PdCu@Fe III -MOF-5.

{"prompt": "A new approach for predicting gas separation performances of MOF membranes\nMetal organic framework (MOF) membranes are widely used for gas separations. Permeability and selectivity of MOF membranes can be accurately calculated using \u2018the detailed method\u2019 which computes transport diffusivities of gases in MOFs' pores. However, this method is computationally demanding therefore not suitable to screen large numbers of MOFs. Another approach is to use \u2018the approximate method\u2019 which uses self-diffusivities of gases to predict gas permeabilities of MOF membranes. The approximate method requires fewer amounts of time compared to the detailed method but significantly underestimates gas permeabilities since mixture correlation effects are ignored in this method. In this work, we first used computationally demanding detailed method to calculate permeabilities and selectivities of 8 different MOF membranes for Xe/Kr and Xe/Ar separations. We then compared these results with the predictions of the approximate method. After observing significant underestimation of the gas permeabilities by the approximate method, we proposed a new computational method to accurately predict gas separation properties of MOF membranes. This new method requires the same computational time and resources with the approximate method but makes much more accurate predictions for gas permeabilities.

{"prompt": "A new water stable zinc metal organic framework as an electrode material for hydrazine sensing\n\u00a9 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of materials exhibiting high surface areas, controlled pore sizes, open metal sites and organic linkers. Utilizing MOFs as direct electrode materials for electrochemical sensing can offer inherent advantages such as containing a sensing element and a redox mediator in a single molecule; however, the direct use of MOFs as electrode materials is hindered because of their insulating nature and less stability in an aqueous medium. In this study, a new water stable Zn-MOF was synthesized and used directly as an electrode material. The Zn-MOF possesses good ability to electrocatalyze the hydrazine oxidation reaction. The Zn-MOF's inherent poor conductivity was overcome by including a hydrophobic electrolyte, tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate tetradodecylammonium salt (ETH 500), during the fabrication of the Zn-MOF membrane. After coating a thin film of the nafion-ETH500 supported Zn-MOF over a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the response for hydrazine oxidation was substantially improved. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) demonstrated a wide linear range from 20 to 350 \u03bcM (R2 = 0.9922) for hydrazine. A detection limit of 2 \u03bcM (n = 3) was observed. The electrochemical behavior of the ZnMOF/ETH500/nafion modified GCE revealed that MOFs have a promising future as electrode materials for direct electrochemical sensing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zn-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"electrode material\", \"hydrazine sensing\", \"electrochemical sensing\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zn-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrazine sensing\", \"electrode material\", \"electrochemical sensing\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Shape engineering of metal\u2013organic frameworks\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials prepared by the self-assembly of metal ions or clusters with organic ligands to form reticular structures. Studies of MOFs started by chemists who looked for materials with new porous structures and topologies. The unique characteristics of MOFs such as high surface areas, low densities, and structural tunability were soon realized and MOF materials have become the platform for applications in many scientific areas, ranging from gas separation to catalysis, magnetism, conductivity, sensing, drug delivery, electronics and others. Recently, the field has been directed towards large-scale synthesis of MOFs and their industrial applications. In terms of synthesis, MOFs are normally isolated as crystalline powders that are not industrially favorable due to their limitations in processing. Shaping MOFs into different forms while preserving or improving their properties offers several advantages as they can be easily processed, handled, and stored. Controlling the shape of MOFs in a systematic way can represent a major step forward to bringing them to the market, testing them at industrial scales and realizing their true potential.

{"prompt": "Tuning the structure and function of metal\u2013organic frameworks via linker design\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions/clusters coordinated by organic linkers (or bridging-ligands). The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters. These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed. The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF. Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application. In this critical review, we highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design. Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, molecular recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described. Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and organic linkers is desirable.

{"prompt": "A transferable model for adsorption in mofs with unsaturated metal sites\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. The number of newly discovered metal-organic frameworks is growing exponentially. Molecular simulation is becoming increasingly important to screen large databases of structures and identify potential candidates for challenging gas separations, but such efforts rely on the availability of accurate molecular models that can predict adsorption in a wide range of different MOFs. MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) pose particular problems because standard force fields are unable to describe their specific interactions with certain adsorbates. In this Article, we demonstrate that our previous approach to describe adsorption in open metal sites, based on a combination of classical Monte Carlo simulations and quantum-mechanical Density Functional Theory calculations, is transferable to several Cu-containing MOFs. By fitting the parameters of our model to match adsorption energies of ethylene on HKUST-1 and transferring them to the Cu-paddlewheel units of other MOFs, we obtain predictions in good agreement with experimental adsorption measurements. Where agreement is not as satisfactory, we show that this can be explained by limited accessibility or diffusion through the pore network. For one particular MOF, UMCM-150, we show that separate parameters need to be used for the Cu-Trimer unit, for which the interaction energies with ethylene are much lower than those in the Cu-paddlewheel. Overall, our approach demonstrates that the specific CUS interactions in MOFs can be parametrized separately from other interaction types, such as van der Waals, thus opening the way for the development of an accurate and fully transferable force field for this class of materials.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-containing MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UMCM-150\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cu-Trimer unit\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"HKUST-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UMCM-150\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"adsorption\", \"gas separations\"]}]"}

Our method showed a great potential of MOF structures in designing and constructing sensitive sensing materials for specific analytes directly via the assembly of functional ions/ligands.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"lanthanide Tb3+ ions and small molecular ligands\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H+\"], \"applications\": [\"fluorescent pH sensor\", \"fluorescent\", \"sensing materials\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"lanthanide Tb3+ ions and small molecular ligands\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"fluorescent pH sensor\", \"luminescence\", \"H+\", \"fluorescent\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "CO2 dynamics in pure and mixed-metal MOFs with open metal sites\n\u00a9 XXXX American Chemical Society. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as MOF-74, can have open metal sites to which adsorbates such as CO2 preferentially bind. 13C NMR of 13CO2 is highly informative about the binding sites present in Mg-MOF-74. We used this technique to investigate loadings between ~0.88 and 1.15 molecules of CO2 per metal in Mg-MOF-74 at 295 K. 13C lineshapes recorded as a function of loading can be understood in terms of the dependence of the CO2 NMR frequency on the angle (?) with respect to the CO2 axis and the channel of the MOF, reflected in the Legendre polynomial, P2. In the fast motion limit, the NMR spectra reveal the time-averaged value of P2, where ? is the angle between the instantaneous CO2 axis and the channel axis. DFT calculations were used to determine a weighted average of P2 in this regime and are in good agreement with experimental data. Static variable temperature 13C NMR from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature was used to investigate 13CO2 binding in Mg-MOF-74 loaded at two levels (~0.88 and 1.08 molecules of CO2 per metal), revealing temperature-dependent lineshapes. We have investigated the effect of partial substitution of Cd for Mg in Mg-MOF-74 on the 13CO2 variable temperature NMR spectra. The chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) that leads to characteristic lineshapes of 13C indicates that incorporation of Cd leads to weaker binding energies for adsorbed CO2.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 dynamics\", \"adsorbed CO2\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 dynamics\", \"adsorbed CO2\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 dynamics\", \"CO2 binding\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\\u2013Cd\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 dynamics\", \"CO2 binding\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Reversible ligand exchange in a metal-organic framework (MOF): Toward MOF-based dynamic combinatorial chemical systems\nReversible benzene dicarboxylate/2-bromobenzene dicarboxylate ligand exchange has been studied in the cubic metal-organic framework MOF-5. Significant exchange (up to \u223c50%), with continuous compositional variation, was observed using ex-situ 1H NMR following treatment over \u223c6 h at \u223c85 C in 10-40 mM ligand solutions. Exchange occurred without significant structural degradation as characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy. Solid-state 13C NMR was used to show that exchanged ligands were incorporated into the framework lattice and not simply adsorbed within the pores. Exchange was found to be sensitive to the small free energy changes caused by the ligand concentration in the exchanging solution indicating that exchange is energetically nearly degenerate. This demonstration of reversible, nearly isoenergetic exchange indicates that mixed ligand MOFs could be developed as dynamic combinatorial chemical systems. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"cubic metal-organic framework\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"ligand exchange\", \"dynamic combinatorial chemical systems\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity and hydrostability of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) with surface-loaded platinum nanoparticles and carbon black\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have generated considerable interest as a potential candidate for hydrogen storage, owing to their extremely high surface-to-volume ratio and low density. However, practical applications have been limited because of low hydrogen storage capacity at room temperature, and of moisture sensitivity of MOFs. To improve hydrogen storage capacity at room temperature and hydrostability under ambient conditions, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were introduced on the outer surface of MOF-5, Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3 that was then coated with hydrophobic microporous carbon black (CB) to generate a CB/Pt/MOF-5 composite. To study the chemical composition, morphology, crystallinity, and properties of the synthesized material, various techniques were employed including wide-angle X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption\u2013desorption analysis. The characterization analyses confirmed the formation of a novel composite designated as CB/Pt/MOF-5 with a highly crystalline structure, and large specific surface area and pore volume. The hydrogen storage capacity (0.62wt.%) of CB/Pt/MOF-5 was superior to that of pristine MOF-5 (0.44wt.%) by 41%; furthermore, CB/Pt/MOF-5 displayed excellent hydrostability under ambient conditions. Overall, these findings indicate that MOF-5 with improved hydrogen storage capacity and hydrostability was successfully synthesized by introducing Pt nanoparticles and a carbon black layer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"hydrogen storage capacity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CB/Pt/MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"hydrogen storage capacity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"hydrogen storage capacity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CB/Pt/MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"hydrogen storage\", \"hydrogen storage capacity\"]}]"}

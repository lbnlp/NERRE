The use of alternative metal precursors would provide a more flexible and cost-effective strategy for direction- and shape-controlled MOF synthesis.

Importantly, the synthesis scheme was found to be transferrable to the production of different linker analogues of the MOF and other topologies.

{"prompt": "The effects of framework dynamics on the behavior of water adsorbed in the [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] and Co-MOF-74 metal\u2013organic frameworks\nThe effects of framework flexibility on the structural and dynamical properties of water adsorbed in two prototypical metal\u2013organic frameworks are investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that water molecules in the pores of a flexible model of [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] exhibit slower dynamics than when the framework is artificially held rigid in the simulations. In contrast, the water dynamics in Co-MOF-74 is predicted to be accelerated by the framework vibrations. The origin of this different behavior directly relates to how water interacts with the two frameworks, which, in turn, determines different hydrogen-bond patterns in the pores. While the first water molecules adsorbed in [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] donate a single hydrogen bond to the Zn\u2013Cl groups and point the other hydrogen atom towards the center of the pore, water molecules adsorbed in Co-MOF-74 initially bind to the cobalt atoms of the framework via their oxygen atoms, thus leaving each molecule free to form two hydrogen bonds with additional molecules adsorbed at higher loading.

{"prompt": "Crosslinked MOF-polymer to enhance gas separation of mixed matrix membranes\nPreparation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) from rigid polymers like PIM-1 remains challenging because the contorted and rigid polymer chains of PIM-1 severely inhibit self-rearrangement leading to low quality of polymer-filler interaction. MMMs prepared by conventional methods, therefore, often suffer from defects at the polymer-filler interface. In this work, a novel filler having hydroxyl functional groups on the surface (Mg-MOF-74) was used as a filler and mixed with PIM-1 in solution (chloroform). Under optimized solution conditions (65\u00b0C and 24h), chemical crosslinking between the hydroxyl groups and the fluoride chain-ends of PIM-1 was facilitated, to completely remove these interfacial defects. The crosslinked MMMs were then characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and mechanical tests, while their separation properties were studied for five gases including H2, CO2, CH4, N2 and O2 upon increasing Mg-MOF-74 loading (0\u201320% wt.). The two main features of MOF-74 (also known as CPO-27), especially Mg-MOF-74, greatly contributing to the membrane gas separation were 1-D hexagonal channels (1.1nm diameter) and an exceptionally high CO2 adsorption capacity under reduced pressures. As the ends of PIM-1 are directly linked with the MOF surface, the intrinsic micropores of PIM-1 are connected to the inner pores of MOF-74 forming an inter-connected micropore network throughout the MMM. Both selectivities and permeabilities of MMM were improved for all the gases, particularly CO2 permeability which increased by 3.2 times from 6500 Barrer for the neat polymer (PIM-1) to 21,000 Barrer for PIM-1 with 20% wt. of MOF-74, meanwhile CO2/CH4 selectivity was improved from 12.3 to 19.1, respectively.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2\", \"O2\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CPO-27\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2\", \"O2\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2\", \"O2\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"membranes\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CO2\", \"CH4\", \"N2\", \"O2\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"membranes\"]}]"}

Efficient processes for adsorptive separation of light olefin/paraffin mixtures are likely to have many advantages over traditional separation techniques for these commodity chemicals. Although some metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied experimentally for this process, a large-scale computational screening study has not been reported due to the inherent difficulty in describing the critical role of interactions of olefins with open metal sites (OMS). In this paper, we introduce new density functional theory (DFT) derived force fields (FFs) that accurately describe adsorption of C2 and C3 olefins and paraffins in CuBTC. Using detailed DFT calculations for MOF-505 and PCN-16, we show that the energetics predicted by our FFs are transferable to other related MOFs that contain Cu OMS. Next, we evaluate the performance of 94 distinct Cu-OMS MOFs for the industrially important propylene/propane separation and identify 18 MOFs predicted to have attractive properties as adsorbents.

{"prompt": "Methane Adsorption in Zr-Based MOFs: Comparison and Critical Evaluation of Force Fields\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. The search for nanoporous materials that are highly performing for gas storage and separation is one of the contemporary challenges in material design. The computational tools to aid these experimental efforts are widely available, and adsorption isotherms are routinely computed for huge sets of (hypothetical) frameworks. Clearly the computational results depend on the interactions between the adsorbed species and the adsorbent, which are commonly described using force fields. In this paper, an extensive comparison and in-depth investigation of several force fields from literature is reported for the case of methane adsorption in the Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks UiO-66, UiO-67, DUT-52, NU-1000, and MOF-808. Significant quantitative differences in the computed uptake are observed when comparing different force fields, but most qualitative features are common which suggests some predictive power of the simulations when it comes to these properties. More insight into the host-guest interactions is obtained by benchmarking the force fields with an extensive number of ab initio computed single molecule interaction energies. This analysis at the molecular level reveals that especially ab initio derived force fields perform well in reproducing the ab initio interaction energies.

{"prompt": "Highly efficient MOF-based self-propelled micromotors for water purification\n\u00a9 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Self-propelled metal-organic framework (MOF)-based Janus micromotors that propel autonomously in hydrogen peroxide and display effective remediation of contaminated water is presented in this work. The novel Janus micromotors rely on the asymmetric deposition of a catalytically active Ag patch on the surface of MOF composite microspheres. The active Ag sites are used for the splitting of H2O2 to form oxygen bubbles. As a result, these Janus micromotors can reach a high speed of over 310 \u03bcm s-1 due to effective bubble propulsion, which is comparable to common Pt-based micromotors. By coupling the high catalytic capacity of MOFs with their autonomous propulsion, the MOF-based micromotors are shown to play a dominant role in the effective removal of organic pollutants. In addition, scanning electronic microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are performed to verify their morphology and composition. Based on the obtained results, a potential mechanism of the motion and the high catalytic activity is also proposed.

{"prompt": "CO2 dynamics in pure and mixed-metal MOFs with open metal sites\n\u00a9 XXXX American Chemical Society. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as MOF-74, can have open metal sites to which adsorbates such as CO2 preferentially bind. 13C NMR of 13CO2 is highly informative about the binding sites present in Mg-MOF-74. We used this technique to investigate loadings between ~0.88 and 1.15 molecules of CO2 per metal in Mg-MOF-74 at 295 K. 13C lineshapes recorded as a function of loading can be understood in terms of the dependence of the CO2 NMR frequency on the angle (?) with respect to the CO2 axis and the channel of the MOF, reflected in the Legendre polynomial, P2. In the fast motion limit, the NMR spectra reveal the time-averaged value of P2, where ? is the angle between the instantaneous CO2 axis and the channel axis. DFT calculations were used to determine a weighted average of P2 in this regime and are in good agreement with experimental data. Static variable temperature 13C NMR from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature was used to investigate 13CO2 binding in Mg-MOF-74 loaded at two levels (~0.88 and 1.08 molecules of CO2 per metal), revealing temperature-dependent lineshapes. We have investigated the effect of partial substitution of Cd for Mg in Mg-MOF-74 on the 13CO2 variable temperature NMR spectra.

Thermal annealing, a commonly used procedure for improving the performance of polymeric membranes, is in this work exploited in the presence of a metal-organic framework (MOF) supported layer. MOFs and polymers are materials with a common organic character, suggesting an enhanced affinity between them when used together in membrane separation. Zeolite-like imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) ZIF-8 and ZIF-93 with sod and rho structures and pore apertures of 0.34 and 0.36 nm, respectively, have been grown inside 356 \u03bcm OD co-polyimide P84 hollow fibers by microfluidics, leading to continuous supported membranes. When these membranes were thermally in situ annealed below the glass transition temperature, while monitoring both H2 and CH4 permeances, the MOF-polymer adhesion was enhanced. Thus the gas separation selectivity increased without any significant reduction in the gas permeance, and H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 maximum selectivities of 103 and 18 (ZIF-8) and 101 and 20 (ZIF-93) were respectively measured. The good compatibility between MOF and polymer made improvements possible in the annealing of the membrane once it was prepared.

{"prompt": "A convenient electrolytic assembly of graphene-MOF composite thin film and its photoanodic application\nIn the recent past, the metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recognized as attractive photosensitizer materials due to their hierarchically ordered structures and attractive light-harvesting characteristics. In this work, we report the application of a graphene-MOF composite as a potential photosensitizer material in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A thin film of graphene-MOF hybrid composite was electrochemically assembled on a TiO2/FTO substrate and the different characteristics of the prepared film were investigated. This novel photoanode material hybrid structure demonstrated the potency of an alternative solid-state DSSC configuration.

{"prompt": "High energy density asymmetric supercapacitors based on MOF-derived nanoporous carbon/manganese dioxide hybrids\nNanoporous carbon materials with high specific surface areas have attracted increasing attention for electrochemical energy storage applications. Metal organic frameworks (MOF) as a good precursor for nanoporous carbon could be used as a promising substrate to improve the energy density of the electrode because of its high specific surface area and high porosity. Here we fabricated MOF-derived nanoporous carbon (MOF-NPC) by direct calcination of zine-based MOF with different carbonization temperatures and synthesized MOF-NPC/MnO2 hybrids via a self-controlled redox process with MnO2 nanostructures well confining in the porous structures of MOF-NPC. An asymmetric supercapacitor has been developed using MOF-NPC/MnO2 hybrids as positive electrode and MOF-NPC as negative electrode in a neutral aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. Due to the excellent structure of MOF-NPC as a porous scaffold, optimized asymmetric device could be reversibly cycled in the voltage range of 0\u20132.2V, and exhibits a maximum energy density of 76.02Whkg\u22121 (for a power density of 2.20kWkg\u22121) and a maximum power density of 22.00kWkg\u22121 (for an energy density of 49.56Whkg\u22121), demonstrating its strong potential for the practical applications of energy storage devices.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"nanoporous carbon/manganese dioxide hybrid\", \"MOF-NPC/MnO2 hybrids\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"electrochemical energy storage\", \"electrode\", \"energy storage devices\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"MOF-derived nanoporous carbon (MOF-NPC)\", \"MOF-NPC/MnO2 hybrids\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"energy storage devices\", \"supercapacitors\"]}]"}

SEM, TGA and DSC suggest the absence of non-selective voids in the Cu3BTC2 and FeBTC MMMs. Gas permeation experiments confirmed this, and showed an increase in ethylene/ethane selectivity of 73% to a value of 7.1, while ethylene permeability remained constant at 17\u00d710\u221218 molm/(m2 sPa) with addition of 20wt% Cu3BTC2. Addition of 20wt% FeBTC showed a reduced permeability, caused by the formation of a denser intermediate layer, and no significant change in selectivity.

{"prompt": "Sensitive and background-free determination of thiols from wastewater samples by MOF-5 extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection using a novel fluorescence probe of carbazole-9-ethyl-2-maleimide\nA sensitive and background-free pre-column derivatization method for the determination of thiol compounds using metal-organic framework material (MOF-5) as dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) adsorbent followed by high-performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) has been developed. In this paper, a novel labeling reagent, carbazole-9-ethyl-2-maleimide(CAEM), was synthesized and reacted with thiols at 40\u00b0C for 10min in the presence of PBS buffer (0.02mol/L, pH 7.5). Interestingly, CAEM itself had no fluorescence, while its derivatives exhibited intense fluorescence with an excitation maximum at \u03bbex 274nm and an emission maximum at \u03bbem 363nm, which greatly reduced the background interference and improved the sensitivity of the method. Furthermore, the MOF-5\u00a0was prepared and used as DSPE adsorbent for the selective adsorption of thiols from wastewater sample. Under the optimized experimental conditions, an excellent linearity for all analytes over their concentration ranges of 0.01\u20131.0\u03bcmol/L (R20.9986)were obtained with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 8\u00a0to 17.1pmol/L for nine tested thiols.

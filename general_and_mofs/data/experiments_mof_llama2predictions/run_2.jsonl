Impressively, mBPV-MOF-Ir exhibited high TONs of up to 17000 for C-H borylation reactions and was recycled more than 15 times. The mPT-MOF-Ir system is also active in catalyzing tandem dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines to azasilolanes in the absence of a hydrogen acceptor. Importantly, MOF-Ir catalysts are significantly more active (up to 95 times) and stable than their homogeneous counterparts for all three reactions, strongly supporting the beneficial effects of active site isolation within MOFs. This work illustrates the ability to increase MOF open channel sizes by using the mixed linker approach and shows the enormous potential of developing highly active and robust single-site solid catalysts based on MOFs containing nitrogen-donor ligands for important organic transformations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Study of the reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of zirconium oxycarbide from Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) precursors\nZirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) precursors were used to synthesize nanopowders of ZrCxOy zirconium oxycarbide. The reaction mechanisms involved in the thermal transformation of two different MOF precursors obtained by using fumaric (H2FUM) and terephthalic (H2BDC) acid as linkers were investigated. The transformation of these two precursors, characterized by two different C/Zr ratio proceeds through an intermediate zirconia phase formed during heating, in association with turbostratic carbon. The zirconia is shown to nucleate within carbon areas coming from the decomposition of the precursors. Zirconia is mainly observed under its tetragonal form in the Zr-BDC carbon rich system (C/Zr = 8) while the monoclinic form predominates in the Zr-FUM low carbon system (C/Zr = 4). The transformation then finally appears very similar to the classical carbothermal reaction between zirconia and carbon black. The reconstructive transformation of zirconia into an oxycarbide phase being highly energy consuming, high temperature heat treatment are required precluding the possibility to obtain the expected nanocrystalline oxycarbide phase by such a way of synthesis. Coupled XRD and TEM study reveals that Zr-BDC system is considered as carbon saturated and the Zr-FUM system appears as carbon deficient. In the Zr-BDC system, zirconia first disappears during the thermal reaction and the oxygen rich oxycarbide that is first formed then reacts with residual carbon to provide progressive carbon enrichment until the saturation of the ZrCxOy oxycarbide solid solution. On the opposite, in the Zr-FUM system, the carbon is the rate-limiting factor of the reaction and the residual zirconia is shown to react with the oxycarbide earlier formed, suggesting the occurrence of a peritectoid like transformation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-BDC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-FUM\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF)\", \"Zr-BDC\", \"Zr-FUM\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"formation of zirconium oxycarbide\"]}]"}

In contrast, the water dynamics in Co-MOF-74 is predicted to be accelerated by the framework vibrations.

While the first water molecules adsorbed in [Zn(l-L)(Cl)] donate a single hydrogen bond to the Zn\u2013Cl groups and point the other hydrogen atom towards the center of the pore, water molecules adsorbed in Co-MOF-74 initially bind to the cobalt atoms of the framework via their oxygen atoms, thus leaving each molecule free to form two hydrogen bonds with additional molecules adsorbed at higher loading.

However, MOF-5 exhibits severe degradation upon contact with atmospheric levels of moisture. The objective of this work is to determine material stability of MOF-5 membranes during pervaporation of organic solvents. High quality MOF-5 membranes about 10\u03bcm in thickness were prepared by the secondary growth method using ball-milled MOF-5 seed crystals. On-stream p-xylene pervaporation test of the as-synthesized MOF-5 membrane shows the p-xylene flux declines and levels off at a steady-state value about 70% of the original value for fresh-membrane after 16h on the stream. The p-xylene flux cannot be restored to the original value, suggesting permanent fouling of the MOF-5 membrane upon exposure to p-xylene stream. Subsequent characterization indicated there was no structural or microstructural degradation that occurred, and evidence of retained xylene isomers in the MOF-5 structure was found using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the fouled MOF-5 membranes exhibit stable pervaporation fluxes for organic molecules with sizes smaller than the aperture of the MOF-5 cage, and exclude organic molecules with sizes larger than MOF-5 aperture.

{"prompt": "Size-Controlled Synthesis of Porphyrinic Metal-Organic Framework and Functionalization for Targeted Photodynamic Therapy\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. The understanding of nanomaterials for targeted cancer therapy is of great importance as physical parameters of nanomaterials have been shown to be strong determinants that can promote cellular responses. However, there have been rare platforms that can vastly tune the core of nanoparticles at a molecular level despite various nanomaterials employed in such studies. Here we show targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Zr(IV)-based porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles. Through a bottom-up approach, the size of MOF nanoparticles was precisely tuned in a broad range with a designed functional motif, built upon selection of building blocks of the MOF. In particular, molecular properties of the porphyrinic linker are maintained in the MOF nanoparticles regardless of their sizes. Therefore, size-dependent cellular uptake and ensuing PDT allowed for screening of the optimal size of MOF nanoparticles for PDT while MOF nanoparticle formulation of the photosensitizer showed better PDT efficacy than that of its small molecule. Additionally, Zr6 clusters in the MOF enabled an active targeting modality through postsynthetic modification, giving even more enhanced PDT efficacy. Together with our finding of size controllability covering a broad range in the nano regime, we envision that MOFs can be a promising nanoplatform by adopting advanced small molecule systems into the tunable framework with room for postsynthetic modification.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr(IV)-based porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"cancer therapy\", \"photodynamic therapy\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zr(IV)-based porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photodynamic therapy\", \"targeted photodynamic therapy\"]}]"}

In this computational study, a pore space partition strategy is employed through a symmetry-matching regulated ligand insertion within the Mg-MOF-74 and Zn-MOF-74 structures, which mitigates the deterioration effect of water. In the case of Zn-MOF-74, higher selectivity as well as larger CO2 uptake in binary mixture conditions is obtained, thereby demonstrating that reduction in the pore size of MOFs can serve as viable strategy to capture CO2 under humid postcombustion conditions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"M-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"humid conditions\", \"CO2 uptake\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\", \"humid conditions\", \"CO2 uptake\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"M-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Mg-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 capture\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Enhanced permeation arising from dual transport pathways in hybrid polymer\u2013MOF membranes\nThe rise of anthropogenic global warming has sparked new interest in developing strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Conventional carbon capture processes are not economically viable at scale due to their enormous energy cost. Membrane-based separation is a promising alternative, but its separation performance has traditionally been limited by a well-known trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Here, we report a hybrid polymer/inorganic membrane with dual transport pathways, which allows us to overcome this traditional limitation. The inorganic phase consists of a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), which is an ideal inorganic dispersant to construct dual transport pathways as the crystalline porous structure of MOFs is more amenable to molecular diffusion than polymers. Previous hybrid membrane research has failed to achieve sufficiently high loadings to establish a percolative network necessary for dual transport, often due to mechanical failure of the membrane at high loading. Using polysulfone and UiO-66-NH2 MOF as a model system, we achieve high MOF loadings (50 wt%) and observe the evolution from single mode to dual transport regimes. The newly formed percolative pathway through the MOF, which has not previously been observed, acts as a molecular highway for gases. As the MOF loading increases to 30 wt%, CO2 permeability increases linearly from 5.6 barrers in polysulfone homopolymer to 18 barrers. Crucially, between 30 and 40 wt%, a percolative MOF network arises and the CO2 permeability dramatically rises from 18 to 46 barrers; an eight-fold increase over pure polysulfone, while maintaining selectivity over methane and nitrogen near the pure polymer at 24 and 26, respectively. A similar phenomenon is observed in the measurement of the diffusion coefficient and is consistent with the formation of dual transport pathways. The findings in this study enable new approaches towards designing hybrid membranes with dual transport pathways. This is an important step towards a competitive membrane-based carbon capture process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"membrane-based separation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"methane\", \"nitrogen\"], \"applications\": [\"carbon capture\", \"separation\"]}]"}

Specifically we synthesized cobalt-based MOF crystals (ZIF-67) onto carbon cloth (CC) and further electrically deposited PANI to give a flexible conductive porous electrode (noted as PANI-ZIF-67-CC) without altering the underlying structure of the MOF. Electrochemical studies showed that the PANI-ZIF-67-CC exhibits an extraordinary areal capacitance of 2146 mF cm-2 at 10 mV s-1.

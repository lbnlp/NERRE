{"prompt": "A mild one-step method for enhancing optical absorption of amine-functionalized metal-organic frameworks\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of significant interest for photocatalysis using visible light. Here we discuss HOMO/LUMO gap modification of amine-functionalized MOFs through a mild one-step method. DFT calculation reveals the formation of covalent bond between TiO2 and the amine from NH2-MIL-125, narrowing the HOMO/LUMO gap of NH2-MIL-125 by raising its HOMO level. After CdS quantum dots (QDs) deposited on this MOF@TiO2 core-shell structure, this composite catalyst can act as an efficient visible-light-driven catalyst for NO removal. The integral coating of amorphous TiO2 onto MOF octahedrons constructs a mesoporous protection shell upon MOF frameworks, providing a superior accommodation for embedding CdS QDs. Integrating MOF with TiO2 also reduces undesirable electron-hole recombination by facilitating charge transfer to amorphous TiO2. Possible mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation of NO over CdS/NH2-MIL-125@TiO2 catalysts is proposed. This work illustrates the possibility of tuning the optical response of NH2-MOFs under very mild condition, and demonstrates the potential usage of MOF-based heterostructured photocatalysts.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-125\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"amine-functionalized MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalysis\", \"photocatalysts\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CdS/NH2-MIL-125@TiO2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"amine-functionalized MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalysis\", \"photocatalysts\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-125\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"amine-functionalized MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalysis\", \"NO removal\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"CdS/NH2-MIL-125@TiO2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalysis\", \"NO removal\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Water Stability of Interpenetrated Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) have been performed to elucidate the underlying water-induced disruption mechanism of several prototypical interpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-9, IRMOF-13, and SUMOF-4). Through the comparison to the corresponding noninterpenetrated MOFs (IRMOF-10 and IRMOF-14), for both the interpenetrated and noninterpenetrated MOFs, structural collapse was always accompanied by the dissociation of the water molecules, with the produced OH- and H+ forming chemical bonds with the Zn2+ ion and O atom of the ligand, respectively. However, the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs is less than that of the corresponding noninterpenetrated structures. The reasons for the differences between the MOFs in the resistance to water attack are clarified. The water resistance of the noninterpenetrated MOFs is mainly attributed to the strength of the Zn-Oligand, but, the hydrogen bond has little effect. However, a trade-off between the strength of the Zn-Oligand bond and the hydrogen bond determines the water stability of the interpenetrated MOFs. We expect that our understanding of the water-disruption mechanisms of MOFs will provide helpful guidance for the design of MOFs with a high water-resistance.

{"prompt": "MOF @ MEMS: Design optimization for high sensitivity chemical detection\nMetal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly developing class of nanoporous materials with numerous applications in diverse fields such as chemical detection, hazardous gas detection, and carbon capture. Even though numerous articles have been written emphasizing the adsorption properties of these MOFs, their compatibility with respect to the sensing device has not been explored. While there are numerous types of sensing devices that could benefit from the use of MOF-based coatings to enhance sensitivity and selectivity, we are particularly interested in microcantilevers because of the high sensitivity they can provide within a compact, lower-power architecture. In this paper, we address this need by analyzing the effect of the mechanical properties of MOFs on the sensor response. In particular, we are interested in the structural flexibility of MOFs, because this unique guest-induced property can be used for strain-induced sensing attribute of the microcantilever. In this regard we examined the effects of important MOF mechanical properties such as the Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density on the sensor response for a range of values representative of the MOFs available in the literature. From our analysis we determined that increasing the Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio improve the response, while the density of the MOF has a negligible effect on the cantilever response. In addition, we also examined the influence on cantilever response of the intermediate layer used to bind the MOF, from which we observe that SiO2 provides the best sensor response for a given MOF layer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"chemical detection\", \"hazardous gas detection\", \"carbon capture\", \"sensing device\", \"sensor response\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"chemical detection\", \"hazardous gas detection\", \"carbon capture\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "CD-MOF: A Versatile Separation Medium\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied in the context of a wide variety of applications, particularly in relation to molecular storage and separation sciences. Recently, we reported a green, renewable framework material composed of \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) and alkali metal salts - namely, CD-MOF. This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry. Here, we report the ability of CD-MOF to separate a wide variety of mixtures, including ethylbenzene from styrene, haloaromatics, terpinenes, pinenes and other chiral compounds. CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol. These findings could lead to cheaper and easier-to-prepare stationary phases for HPLC separations when compared with other chiral stationary phases, such as CD-bonded silica particles.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"CD-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation\", \"molecular storage\", \"separation of mixtures\", \"separation of alkylaromatic compounds\", \"petrochemical industry\", \"HPLC separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"CD-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation\", \"molecular storage\", \"chromatography\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "MOF Crystal Chemistry Paving the Way to Gas Storage Needs: Aluminum-Based soc -MOF for CH4, O2, and CO2 Storage\n\u00a9 2015 American Chemical Society. The molecular building block approach was employed effectively to construct a series of novel isoreticular, highly porous and stable, aluminum-based metal-organic frameworks with soc topology. From this platform, three compounds were experimentally isolated and fully characterized: namely, the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 and its naphthalene and anthracene analogues. Al-soc-MOF-1 exhibits outstanding gravimetric methane uptake (total and working capacity). It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the Al-soc-MOF platform can address the challenging Department of Energy dual target of 0.5 g/g (gravimetric) and 264 cm3 (STP)/cm3 (volumetric) methane storage. Furthermore, Al-soc-MOF exhibited the highest total gravimetric and volumetric uptake for carbon dioxide and the utmost total and deliverable uptake for oxygen at relatively high pressures among all microporous MOFs. In order to correlate the MOF pore structure and functionality to the gas storage properties, to better understand the structure-property relationship, we performed a molecular simulation study and evaluated the methane storage performance of the Al-soc-MOF platform using diverse organic linkers. It was found that shortening the parent Al-soc-MOF-1 linker resulted in a noticeable enhancement in the working volumetric capacity at specific temperatures and pressures with amply conserved gravimetric uptake/working capacity. In contrast, further expansion of the organic linker (branches and/or core) led to isostructural Al-soc-MOFs with enhanced gravimetric uptake but noticeably lower volumetric capacity.

{"prompt": "Effect of catenation and basicity of pillared ligands on the water stability of MOFs\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have extremely high surface areas and pore volumes, tunable pore sizes and chemical functionalities and are an interesting addition to the field of porous materials. One of the key challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value). This study shows that after 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption.

{"prompt": "Rapid microwave-hydrothermal conversion of lignin model compounds to value-added products via catalytic oxidation using metal organic frameworks\nMicrowave irradiation is an effective method for faster heating to shorten reaction time of oxidative valorization of lignin. However, studies using microwave irradiation for lignin oxidation all employ homogeneous catalysis. Thus, this study aims to investigate heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of lignin under microwave irradiation. Especially, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are adopted as transition metal-containing heterogeneous catalysts for lignin oxidation. In particularly, MOFs (MIL-101 (Cr), MIL-101 (Fe), UiO-66, HKUST-1, and MOF-801) are also prepared using microwave irradiation and used as for oxidative conversion of a model lignin compound, vanillyl alcohol (VAL), to the valuable products, vanillin (VN) and vanillic acid (VAC), using H2O2 as an oxidant. While the tested MOFs all exhibit catalytic activities for VAL conversion to VN/VAC, MIL-101 and MOF-801 appear to be relatively effective. Through investigating the effect of temperature, VAL conversion to VN/VAC is less favorable at higher temperature possibly due to degradation of H2O2 at high temperatures. While a higher dosage of H2O2 increases VAL conversion, the additionally added H2O2 seems to further oxidize VN to VAC instead of converting more VAL to VN. Through the EPR analyses, the mechanism of VAL conversion to VN/VAC may be attributed to both the OH-based and non-OH\u2022 routes. The most effective MOF, MOF-801, also exhibited very similar catalytic activities over several cycles. The results indicate that MOFs can convert VAL to valuable products of VN and VAC within a very short time (10\u00a0min) under microwave irradiation.

{"prompt": "Stability of MOF-5 in a hydrogen gas environment containing fueling station impurities\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous, crystalline materials with potential application as hydrogen storage media in fuel cell vehicles. Unlike lower capacity adsorbents such as zeolites and carbons, some MOFs are expected to degrade due to attack by impurities present in the hydrogen fuel stream. Hydrogen intended for use in fuel cell vehicles should satisfy purity standards, such as those outlined in SAE J2719. This standard limits the concentration of certain species in the fuel stream based primarily on their deleterious effects on PEM fuel cells. However, the impact of these contaminants on MOFs is mostly unknown. In the present study MOF-5 is adopted as a prototypical moisture-sensitive hydrogen storage material.

Subsequently, MOF-5 was exposed to these mixtures over hundreds of adsorption/desorption pressure-swing cycles and for extended periods of static exposure. The impact of exposure was assessed by periodically measuring the hydrogen storage capacity of an exposed sample. Hydrogen chloride was observed to be the only impurity that yielded a measurable, albeit small, decrease in hydrogen capacity; no change in H2 uptake was observed for the other impurities. Post-cycling and post-storage MOF-5 samples were also analyzed using infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction.

{"prompt": "MOF derived Mesoporous Nitrogen doped Carbons with high Activity towards Oxygen Reduction\nIn order to obtain Platinum-free catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) in Fuel Cells, Nitrogen doped mesoporous carbons were prepared from pyrolysis of three Cobalt metal organic frameworks (MOFs), one linear coordination polymer and one complex. Electron micrographs revealed the presence of pores of different sizes in the samples. Particles resembled polyhedrons, sponges, bars, etc. The catalyst derived from Cobalt 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate polymer (700\u00b0C) exhibited attractive electrokinetic parameters for the ORR comparable to those of Pt 20% in acidic medium (Tafel slope=82 mV dec\u22121, exchange current density=10mAcm\u22121, equilibrium potential=907 mV (vs RHE), half wave potential=720 mV (vs RHE), number of exchanged electrons ca. 4.0, 0.5 M H2SO4). Limiting current and H2O2 yield ( 10%) are similar to those of ZIF-67 derived materials. The half wave potential is shifted to 820 mv (vs RHE) in alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The former sample holds a surface area on mesopores which duplicates that of the ZIF-67 700\u00b0C. A correlation was found between the current intensity for the ORR and the mesopore area occupied by N (%N x specific area on mesopores). The Cobalt 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate derived material (700\u00b0C) showed high methanol tolerance compared to Pt 20% (0.05 M methanol, 0.5 M H2SO4), and good ORR durability (after 3000 cycles between 0.25\u20131.15 V vs RHE, O2 saturated 0.5M H2SO4).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cobalt 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Oxygen Reduction\", \"ORR\", \"Fuel Cells\"]}, {\"applications\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"name_of_mof\": [\"ZIF-67\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Cobalt 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylate polymer\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Oxygen Reduction Reaction\", \"ORR\", \"Fuel Cells\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Thermochemistry of paddle wheel MOFs: Cu-HKUST-1 and Zn-HKUST-1\nMetal-organic framework (MOF) porosity relies upon robust metal-organic bonds to retain structural rigidity upon solvent removal. Both the as-synthesized and activated Cu and Zn polymorphs of HKUST-1 were studied by room temperature acid solution calorimetry. Their enthalpies of formation from dense assemblages (metal oxide (ZnO or CuO), trimesic acid (TMA), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)) were calculated from the calorimetric data. The enthalpy of formation (\u0394Hf) of the as-synthesized Cu-HKUST-H2O ([Cu3TMA2\u00b73H 2O]\u00b75DMF) is -52.70 \u00b1 0.34 kJ per mole of Cu.

The \u0394Hf for Zn-HKUST-amorph [Zn3TMA2\u00b72DMF] is -3.57 \u00b1 0.21 kJ per mole of Zn. Solvent stabilizes the Cu-HKUST-H2O by -69.4 kJ per mole of Cu and Zn-HKUST-DMF by at least -50.7 kJ per mole of Zn. Such strong chemisorption of solvent is similar in magnitude to the strongly exothermic binding at low coverage for chemisorbed H2O on transition metal oxide nanoparticle surfaces.

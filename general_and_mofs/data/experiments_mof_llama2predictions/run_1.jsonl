{"prompt": "Sensitivity enhancement in planar microwave active-resonator using metal organic framework for CO2 detection\nThis work presents a proof of concepts of CO2 gas monitoring by a microwave sensor operating in microwave regime and study its sensitivity enhancement using an adsorbent bed of commercially available Zeolite 13X, and two synthesized MOF-199 (MOF-199-M1 and MOF-199-M2). The sensing principle of the sensor is based on the change in the dielectric properties of the bed, in response to CO2 concentration change in the dry CO2/He mixture. The sensor\u2019s response is quantified in terms of change in the resonant frequency with respect to baseline for each material. The sensor shows maximum sensitivity of 24kHz/% CO2 for MOF-199-M2 and minimum of 10kHz/% CO2 for Zeolite 13 X. The sensitivity of the microwave senor to CO2 concentration, with MOF-199-M2 as the bed is higher than MOF-199-M1, which can be related to the presence of different amount of unsaturated Cu2+ ions in their frameworks. XPS and XRD studies revealed marginal structure difference between MOF-199-M1 and MOF-199-M2. MOF-199-M2 has higher adsorption capacity compared to Zeolite 13 X and MOF-199-M1 at CO2 concentration 45 vol.% which demonstrates potential application of microwave sensors even at high CO2 concentration (45 vol.%) using MOF-199-M2. Further work needs to study the sensor\u2019s performance in non-dry gas streams at different levels of humidity and its integration with different materials to address the practical challenges, and to improve the selectivity of the sensor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Impact of Disordered Guest-Framework Interactions on the Crystallography of Metal-Organic Frameworks\n\u00a9 2018 American Chemical Society. It is a general and common practice to carry out single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments at cryogenic temperatures in order to obtain high-resolution data. In this report, we show that this practice is not always applicable to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), especially when these structures are highly porous. Specifically, two new MOFs are reported here, MOF-1004 and MOF-1005, for which the collection of the diffraction data at lower temperature (100 K) did not give data of sufficient quality to allow structure solution. However, collection of data at higher temperature (290 K) gave atomic-resolution data for MOF-1004 and MOF-1005, allowing for structure solution. We find that this inverse behavior, contrary to normal practice, is also true for some well-established MOFs (MOF-177 and UiO-67). Close examination of the X-ray diffraction data obtained for all four of these MOFs at various temperatures led us to conclude that disordered guest-framework interactions play a profound role in introducing disorder at low temperature, and the diminishing strength of these interactions at high temperatures reduces the disorder and gives high-resolution diffraction data. We believe our finding here is more widely applicable to other highly porous MOFs and crystals containing highly disordered molecules.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-1004\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-1005\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-177\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-67\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-1004\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"X-ray diffraction\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-1005\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"X-ray diffraction\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-177\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"X-ray diffraction\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-67\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"X-ray diffraction\"]}]"}

On-stream p-xylene pervaporation test of the as-synthesized MOF-5 membrane shows the p-xylene flux declines and levels off at a steady-state value about 70% of the original value for fresh-membrane after 16h on the stream. The p-xylene flux cannot be restored to the original value, suggesting permanent fouling of the MOF-5 membrane upon exposure to p-xylene stream. Subsequent characterization indicated there was no structural or microstructural degradation that occurred, and evidence of retained xylene isomers in the MOF-5 structure was found using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the fouled MOF-5 membranes exhibit stable pervaporation fluxes for organic molecules with sizes smaller than the aperture of the MOF-5 cage, and exclude organic molecules with sizes larger than MOF-5 aperture. The results show that the MOF-5 membranes, after a permanent reduction in permeation flux by initial exposure to xylene stream, are stable in organic solvent and can be used for separation of liquid organic molecules based on the molecular sieving effects.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of large molecules\", \"pervaporation\", \"separation of liquid organic molecules\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of large molecules\", \"permeation\", \"membranes\", \"pervaporation\", \"organic solvent\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Electronic Properties of Bimetallic Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs): Tailoring the Density of Electronic States through MOF Modularity\n\u00a9 2017 American Chemical Society.  The development of porous well-defined hybrid materials (e.g., metal-organic frameworks or MOFs) will add a new dimension to a wide number of applications ranging from supercapacitors and electrodes to \"smart\" membranes and thermoelectrics. From this perspective, the understanding and tailoring of the electronic properties of MOFs are key fundamental challenges that could unlock the full potential of these materials. In this work, we focused on the fundamental insights responsible for the electronic properties of three distinct classes of bimetallic systems, M x-y M\u2032 y -MOFs, M x M\u2032 y -MOFs, and M x (ligand-M\u2032 y )-MOFs, in which the second metal (M\u2032) incorporation occurs through (i) metal (M) replacement in the framework nodes (type I), (ii) metal node extension (type II), and (iii) metal coordination to the organic ligand (type III), respectively. We employed microwave conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, pressed-pellet conductivity, and theoretical modeling to shed light on the key factors responsible for the tunability of MOF electronic structures. Experimental prescreening of MOFs was performed based on changes in the density of electronic states near the Fermi edge, which was used as a starting point for further selection of suitable MOFs. As a result, we demonstrated that the tailoring of MOF electronic properties could be performed as a function of metal node engineering, framework topology, and/or the presence of unsaturated metal sites while preserving framework porosity and structural integrity. These studies unveil the possible pathways for transforming the electronic properties of MOFs from insulating to semiconducting, as well as provide a blueprint for the development of hybrid porous materials with desirable electronic structures.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"supercapacitors\", \"electrodes\", \"membranes\", \"thermoelectrics\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"supercapacitors\", \"electrodes\", \"smart\" membranes\", \"thermoelectrics\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "CD-MOF: A Versatile Separation Medium\n\u00a9 2016 American Chemical Society. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied in the context of a wide variety of applications, particularly in relation to molecular storage and separation sciences. Recently, we reported a green, renewable framework material composed of \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) and alkali metal salts - namely, CD-MOF. This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry. Here, we report the ability of CD-MOF to separate a wide variety of mixtures, including ethylbenzene from styrene, haloaromatics, terpinenes, pinenes and other chiral compounds. CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol. These findings could lead to cheaper and easier-to-prepare stationary phases for HPLC separations when compared with other chiral stationary phases, such as CD-bonded silica particles.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"CD-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"separation\", \"molecular storage\", \"separation of mixtures\", \"separation of alkylaromatic compounds\", \"petrochemical industry\", \"HPLC separations\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"CD-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"molecular storage\", \"separation sciences\", \"separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds\", \"separation of a wide variety of mixtures\", \"HPLC separations\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Performance and plasticization behavior of polymer\u2013MOF membranes for gas separation at elevated pressures\nMixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on three distinctively different MOFs (MIL-53(Al) (breathing MOF), ZIF-8 (flexible MOF) and Cu3BTC2 (rigid MOF)) dispersed in Matrimid\u00ae-PI have been investigated. MOF loading was varied between 0wt% and 30wt%. The fabricated MOF-MMMs were characterized for pure and binary gas mixture separations at low and high pressures and their performance in terms of CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity was evaluated. The use of a less volatile co-solvent, optimized priming protocol to prepare the MMMs and thermal annealing resulted in a good dispersion of MOF particles in the Matrimid\u00ae-PI matrix. Incorporation of MOFs resulted in increased density, Tg and improved degradation behavior of the membranes confirming a good compatibility between the polymer and the MOFs. Low pressure gas separation showed moderate enhancement in CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity of MOF-MMMs compared to native polymer membranes, but the improvement becomes pronounced at high pressures. At high pressures, the native Matrimid\u00ae-PI membrane showed typical plasticization behavior, while in MMMs, MOF particles limit the mobility of polymer chains thus suppressing CO2 induced plasticization and maintain large separation factors over a wide pressure range investigated. The respective increase in performance of MMMs is very much dependent on MOF crystal structure and its interactions with CO2 gas molecules. Among the three MOF-MMMs, membranes based on Cu3BTC2 showed highest selectivity while ZIF-8 based membranes showed highest permeability. In general it can be concluded that the high CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity of MMMs is the combined effect of an increased sorption and diffusion selectivity and reduced plasticization. Overall, this work reveals that MOF-MMMs delay CO2 induced plasticization and show good separation performance even at high pressures, showing their potential to a wide range of newly emerging high pressure energy applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-53(Al)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"breathing MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"flexible MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cu3BTC2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"rigid MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-53(Al)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"breathing MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"flexible MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cu3BTC2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"rigid MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"gas separation\", \"CO2 permeability\", \"CO2/CH4 selectivity\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Effect of catenation and basicity of pillared ligands on the water stability of MOFs\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have extremely high surface areas and pore volumes, tunable pore sizes and chemical functionalities and are an interesting addition to the field of porous materials. One of the key challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value). This study shows that after 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption. In contrast, comparing non-catenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-508-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-BPY\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-BDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"DMOF-TM\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn-TMBDC-DABCO\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\", \"porous materials\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\", \"porous materials\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\", \"porous materials\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water stability\", \"porous materials\"]}]"}

Furthermore, the performance of the MOF spheres was compared to that of compressed pellets in terms of NH3 adsorption using a breakthrough test, and CO2 and N2 adsorption performance was compared using adsorption isotherms at 298 K between the powder and spheres of MOFs for future industrial applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-100(Fe)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"NH3\", \"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 adsorption\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-101(Cr)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"NH3\", \"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 adsorption\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66(Zr)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"NH3\", \"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 adsorption\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66(Zr)-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"NH3\", \"CO2\", \"N2\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 adsorption\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-100(Fe)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 and N2 adsorption\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MIL-101(Cr)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 and N2 adsorption\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66(Zr)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 and N2 adsorption\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"UiO-66(Zr)-NH2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"NH3 adsorption\", \"CO2 and N2 adsorption\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Water adsorption in porous metal-organic frameworks and related materials\nWater adsorption in porous materials is important for many applications such as dehumidification, thermal batteries, and delivery of drinking water in remote areas. In this study, we have identified three criteria for achieving high performing porous materials for water adsorption. These criteria deal with condensation pressure of water in the pores, uptake capacity, and recyclability and water stability of the material. In search of an excellently performing porous material, we have studied and compared the water adsorption properties of 23 materials, 20 of which are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Among the MOFs are 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), -802, -805, -806, -808, -812, and -841 reported for the first time. MOF-801-P (microcrystalline powder form) was reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption properties. MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examined for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis. All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr 6O4(OH)4(-CO2)n secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl organic linkers to make extended porous frameworks. The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temperature. An X-ray single-crystal study and a powder neutron diffraction study reveal the position of the water adsorption sites in MOF-801 and highlight the importance of the intermolecular interaction between adsorbed water molecules within the pores. \u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-801\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-802\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-805\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-806\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-808\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-812\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-841\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"water\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water in remote areas\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-801-SC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-802\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-805\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-806\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-808\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-812\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-841\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"zirconium(IV) MOFs\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"water adsorption\", \"dehumidification\", \"thermal batteries\", \"delivery of drinking water\", \"water stability\"]}]"}

The inserted metal ions are coordinated within an unusual all-oxygen trigonal ligand field and are accessible to both inner- and outer-sphere oxidants: Cr2+- converts into Cr3+-substituted MOF-5, while Fe2+-MOF-5 activates NO to produce an unusual Fe-nitrosyl complex. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cr-MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Fe-MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"NO activation\"]}, {\"applications\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"name_of_mof\": [\"Ti-MOF-5\"]}, {\"applications\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"name_of_mof\": [\"V-MOF-5\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"Zn4O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)3\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cr2+-substituted MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cr3+-substituted MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Ti3+-substituted MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"V2+/3+-substituted MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Mn 2+-substituted MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Fe2+-substituted MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"Lewis acid catalysts\", \"electron transfer\", \"reduced oxidation states\", \"redox chemistry\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "Using Hansen solubility parameters to study the encapsulation of caffeine in MOFs\nHansen solubility parameters (HSP) have found their greatest use in the evaluation of solvent\u2013polymer chemical interactions. Given their great interest among the scientific community, host\u2013guest interactions in metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), with organic and inorganic moieties, could benefit from a HSP approach. In this work we have initiated the application of HSP to the study of caffeine encapsulation in MOFs ZIF-8 and NH2-MIL-88B(Fe). However, the availability of HSP for MOFs is nearly zero. As a first step to evaluating the potential of HSP for rational design we have made the simplifying assumption that the HSP distance of the caffeine\u2013ligand interaction (i.e. ignoring the metal and the MOF structure) dominates the ability to form a MOF host\u2013guest system. Although much work remains to be done, the first indications are that this approach has much potential.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"caffeine encapsulation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-88B(Fe)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"caffeine encapsulation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"caffeine encapsulation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"NH2-MIL-88B(Fe)\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"caffeine encapsulation\"]}]"}
{"prompt": "MOF based MMMs with enhanced selectivity due to hindered linker distortion\nIn this paper the separation of the binary mixture H2/CH4 on (i) neat supported ZIF (zeolitic imidazolate framework) membranes of types ZIF-8 and ZIF-90, (ii) a neat supported Matrimid polymer membrane, and (iii) Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs) with 10, 20 and 30vol-% ZIF-8 and ZIF-90 nanocrystals in Matrimid is compared. A high separation performance was found surprisingly for the MMMs and it was concluded that the polymer matrix prevents the framework flexibility of the embedded Metal Organic Framework (MOF) particles, thus increasing the selectivity of MMMs with particle loadings \u226420vol-%. Higher loadings, however, lead to agglomerations and segregations, which result in MMMs with lower selectivities. To approve the idea of the hindered linker distortion caused by the surrounding polymer, we coated the top of neat supported ZIF-8 and neat ZIF-90 membranes with an additional Matrimid polymer layer (dual-layer membrane). Indeed, the polymer coating also caused a suppression of the linker distortion of the ZIF layer in contact with the polymer which results in an enhanced H2/CH4 selectivity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of the binary mixture H2/CH4\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-90\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of the binary mixture H2/CH4\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-8\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of the binary mixture H2/CH4\", \"H2/CH4 selectivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"ZIF-90\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"separation of the binary mixture H2/CH4\", \"H2/CH4 selectivity\"]}]"}

{"prompt": "Post-synthesis modification of a metal\u2013organic framework to construct a bifunctional photocatalyst for hydrogen production\nTo construct photocatalytically active MOFs, various strategies have recently been developed.

The functionalized MOF-253-Pt serves both as a photosensitizer and a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of MOF-253-Pt is approximately five times higher than that of the corresponding complex. The presence of the short Pt\u22efPt interactions in the framework was revealed with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and low temperature luminescence.

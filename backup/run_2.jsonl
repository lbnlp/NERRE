The reaction mechanisms involved in the thermal transformation of two different MOF precursors obtained by using fumaric (H2FUM) and terephthalic (H2BDC) acid as linkers were investigated. The transformation of these two precursors, characterized by two different C/Zr ratio proceeds through an intermediate zirconia phase formed during heating, in association with turbostratic carbon. The zirconia is shown to nucleate within carbon areas coming from the decomposition of the precursors. Zirconia is mainly observed under its tetragonal form in the Zr-BDC carbon rich system (C/Zr = 8) while the monoclinic form predominates in the Zr-FUM low carbon system (C/Zr = 4). The transformation then finally appears very similar to the classical carbothermal reaction between zirconia and carbon black. The reconstructive transformation of zirconia into an oxycarbide phase being highly energy consuming, high temperature heat treatment are required precluding the possibility to obtain the expected nanocrystalline oxycarbide phase by such a way of synthesis. Coupled XRD and TEM study reveals that Zr-BDC system is considered as carbon saturated and the Zr-FUM system appears as carbon deficient. In the Zr-BDC system, zirconia first disappears during the thermal reaction and the oxygen rich oxycarbide that is first formed then reacts with residual carbon to provide progressive carbon enrichment until the saturation of the ZrCxOy oxycarbide solid solution.

MOF-polymer interaction is optimized through this strategy and it overcomes MOF-polymer incompatibility, MOF agglomeration and MOF distribution problems, happening especially at high loadings of MOFs when applying conventional methods.

The surface of these particles was then modified by the introduction of imidazole groups, enhancing the chemical compatibility with the selected ZIF-8 MOF. ZIF-8 nanoparticles were then grown in-situ to this modified polymer particle suspension by addition of the precursor for ZIF-8 synthesis. The resulted suspension was cast to dryness and annealed in a solvent\u2013vapor environment to induce particle fusion, leading to a dense MMM structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed an excellent dispersion of the ZIF-8 nanoparticles forming a percolating pathway without any agglomeration, even at 40wt% loading of the ZIF-8.

The CO2 permeability of the MMMs increased by 200% and the CO2/CH4 selectivity increased by 65% as compared to unfilled Matrimid\u00ae. More detailed analysis of the gas transport performance of the MMMs showed that the CO2 permeability and the CO2/CH4 selectivity are mainly governed by the increase in CO2 diffusivity.

Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, molecular recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described. Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and organic linkers is desirable. In this review, linkers are categorized as ditopic (Section 1), tritopic (Section 2), tetratopic (Section 3), hexatopic (Section 4), octatopic (Section 5), mixed (Section 6), desymmetrized (Section 7), metallo (Section 8), and N-heterocyclic linkers (Section 9).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalysis\", \"molecular recognition\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalysis\", \"molecular recognition\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "Azamacrocyclic-based metal organic frameworks: Design strategies and applications\nPolyazamacrocycles and its functionalized derivatives have been employed recently as organic building blocks in the construction of extended metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs).

However, MOFs with mesopores are rarely studied because of the lack of a simple, effective way to construct mesoscale cavities in the structures. Here, we report the use of a perturbation-assisted nanofusion technique to construct hierarchically superstructured MOFs.

However, their instability in the presence of water vapor (many MOFs are hygroscopic) is one of the key issues that limit their large-scale application. Previous studies of water adsorption in MOFs have mainly relied on isotherm measurements that provide useful parameters such as adsorption uptake and isosteric heat of adsorption. The structural stability of MOFs in water vapor was also evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD). However, more studies are required to unravel the water interaction or reaction mechanisms within MOFs, which would be beneficial for the development of more robust frameworks. This review highlight focuses on water adsorption in two representative MOFs: M(bdc)(ted)0.5 [M = Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; ted = triethylenediamine] with saturated metal centers and MOF-74 [M2(dobdc), M = Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and dobdc = 2,5-dihydroxybenzenedicarboxylic acid] with unsaturated metal centers. It shows how vibrational spectroscopy combined with van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) calculations makes it possible to elucidate the details of water reaction in MOFs. The results presented in this highlight suggest that the reactivity and initial decomposition pathway of MOFs in water vapor critically depend on their structure and the specific metal cation in the building units. Water interaction with a hydrophobic MOF, in this case FMOF-1, is also reviewed. This information provides a framework for understanding water interactions or reactions within different types of MOFs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption and separation\", \"CO2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"M(bdc)(ted)0.5 [M = Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; ted = triethylenediamine]\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption and separation\", \"CO2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"FMOF-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption and separation\", \"CO2 capture\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"M(bdc)(ted)0.5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption and separation\", \"H2 and CH4 storage\", \"CO2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-74\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption and separation\", \"H2 and CH4 storage\", \"CO2 capture\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"FMOF-1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"H2\", \"CH4\"], \"applications\": [\"gas adsorption and separation\", \"H2 and CH4 storage\", \"CO2 capture\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "Tuning the porosity of lanthanide MOFs with 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylate and the first in situ hydrothermal carboxyl transfer\nReacting lanthanide nitrates with 2,5-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,5-pzdcH2) and oxalic acid (oxH2) hydrothermally at 140 \u00b0C yielded a series of MOFs with 1D nano-sized channels, [Ln(2,5-pzdc)(ox)0.5(H2O)2]\u00b74.5H2O (1-Ln; Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy), different from previously reported ultra-microporous [Ln(2,5-pzdc)1.5(H2O)3]\u00b70.5H2O.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as MOF-74, can have open metal sites to which adsorbates such as CO2 preferentially bind. 13C NMR of 13CO2 is highly informative about the binding sites present in Mg-MOF-74. We used this technique to investigate loadings between ~0.88 and 1.15 molecules of CO2 per metal in Mg-MOF-74 at 295 K. 13C lineshapes recorded as a function of loading can be understood in terms of the dependence of the CO2 NMR frequency on the angle (?) with respect to the CO2 axis and the channel of the MOF, reflected in the Legendre polynomial, P2. In the fast motion limit, the NMR spectra reveal the time-averaged value of P2, where ? is the angle between the instantaneous CO2 axis and the channel axis. DFT calculations were used to determine a weighted average of P2 in this regime and are in good agreement with experimental data. Static variable temperature 13C NMR from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature was used to investigate 13CO2 binding in Mg-MOF-74 loaded at two levels (~0.88 and 1.08 molecules of CO2 per metal), revealing temperature-dependent lineshapes.

Imidazole molecules were frequently incorporated into porous materials to improve their proton conductivity. To investigate how different arrangements of imidazoles in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) affect the overall proton conduction, we designed and prepared a MOF-based model system. It includes an Fe-MOF as the blank, an imidazole@Fe-MOF (Im@Fe-MOF) with physically adsorbed imidazole, and an imidazole-Fe-MOF (Im-Fe-MOF), which contains chemically coordinated imidazole molecules. The parent Fe-MOF, synthesized from the exchange of carboxylates in the preformed [Fe3(\u03bc3-O)](carboxylate)6 clusters and multitopic carboxylate ligands, serves as a control. The Im@Fe-MOF was prepared by encapsulating free imidazole molecules into the pores of the Fe-MOF, whereas the Im-Fe-MOF was obtained in situ, in which imidazole ligands coordinate to the metal nodes of the framework. Proton-conductivity analyses revealed that the proton conductivity of Im-Fe-MOF was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those of Fe-MOF and Im@Fe-MOF at room temperature. The high proton conductivity of 1.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C for Im-Fe-MOF ranks among the highest performing MOFs ever reported. The results of the density functional theory calculations suggest that coordinated imidazole molecules in Im-Fe-MOF provide a greater concentration of protons for proton transportation than do coordinated water molecules in Fe-MOF alone. Besides, Im-Fe-MOF exhibits steadier performance than Im@Fe-MOF does after being washed with water. Our investigation using the above ideal crystalline model system demonstrates that compared to disorderly arranged imidazole molecules in pores, the immobilized imidazole molecules by coordination bonds in the framework are more prone to form proton-conduction pathways and thus perform better and steadier in water-mediated proton conduction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole@Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im-Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole-Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Fe-MOF\", \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"Im-Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\", \"proton transportation\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "Study of the reaction mechanisms involved in the formation of zirconium oxycarbide from Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) precursors\nZirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) precursors were used to synthesize nanopowders of ZrCxOy zirconium oxycarbide. The reaction mechanisms involved in the thermal transformation of two different MOF precursors obtained by using fumaric (H2FUM) and terephthalic (H2BDC) acid as linkers were investigated. The transformation of these two precursors, characterized by two different C/Zr ratio proceeds through an intermediate zirconia phase formed during heating, in association with turbostratic carbon. The zirconia is shown to nucleate within carbon areas coming from the decomposition of the precursors. Zirconia is mainly observed under its tetragonal form in the Zr-BDC carbon rich system (C/Zr = 8) while the monoclinic form predominates in the Zr-FUM low carbon system (C/Zr = 4). The transformation then finally appears very similar to the classical carbothermal reaction between zirconia and carbon black. The reconstructive transformation of zirconia into an oxycarbide phase being highly energy consuming, high temperature heat treatment are required precluding the possibility to obtain the expected nanocrystalline oxycarbide phase by such a way of synthesis. Coupled XRD and TEM study reveals that Zr-BDC system is considered as carbon saturated and the Zr-FUM system appears as carbon deficient. In the Zr-BDC system, zirconia first disappears during the thermal reaction and the oxygen rich oxycarbide that is first formed then reacts with residual carbon to provide progressive carbon enrichment until the saturation of the ZrCxOy oxycarbide solid solution. On the opposite, in the Zr-FUM system, the carbon is the rate-limiting factor of the reaction and the residual zirconia is shown to react with the oxycarbide earlier formed, suggesting the occurrence of a peritectoid like transformation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-BDC\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Zr-FUM\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Zirconium-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "SnO2-MOF-Fabry-Perot optical sensor for relative humidity measurements\nIn this paper, a new optical fiber sensor for relative humidity measurements is presented and characterized.

The feasibility of the device as a breathing sensor is also experimentally demonstrated. The interrogation of the sensing head is carried out by monitoring the Fast Fourier Transform phase variations of the FP interference frequency. This method substitutes the necessity of tracking the optical spectrum peaks or valleys, which can be a handicap when noise or multiple contributions are present: therefore, it is low-sensitive to noise and to artifacts signal amplitude. The sensor shows a linear behavior in a wide relative humidity range (20%\u201390% relative humidity) in which the sensitivity is 0.14rad/%; the maximum observed instability is 0.007rad, whereas the highest hysteresis is 5% RH.

The corresponding MOF nanoparticles are prepared by a hydrothermal method and the optical thin films are successfully prepared by spin-coating.

The photoexcitation of the MOF forming the composites (dyes@MOF) leads to an energy transfer (ET) to the trapped dyes, opening the door to tune the material emission.

These mean ET times, which are guest-concentration dependent, reflect the different dye occupancies in the MOF pores. For trapped NR and DCM molecules, because of a different emission (energy donor) and absorption (energy acceptor) spectral overlap, the ET takes place from the excimers and not from the monomers.

Management of radioactive noble gases, i.e., Xe and Kr, needs special attention in the context of nuclear fuel reprocessing and postulated severe accident scenarios. Entrapment of these species in suitable matrix is generally difficult since Xe and Kr do not form bonds with substrates (physisorbed by van der Waals interactions) due to their chemical inertness. In recent years metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are being actively discussed for adsorption/separation of various gases including noble gases. MOFs are considered superior in such applications owing to their high intake capacity, better selectivity and also the possibility of tuning the chemical properties by varying organic linkers or metal atoms. Theoretical modeling of MOFs and tailoring their properties appropriately for noble gas adsorption/separation are potentially useful to identify suitable candidates. In this regard, we investigate the binding energies of Xe and Kr in the well-known M-MOF-74 employing computer simulations. To understand the influence of different open metal sites on binding affinity, the central metal ion in M-MOF-74 are varied. Our results show that Xe binds stronger than Kr and binding strength changes with the nature of the central metal atom in the MOF. The adsorption behavior obtained from our calculations is in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical observations. The binding strength at different adsorption sites are favored by van der Waals interactions between noble gas atoms with MOF network and each other.

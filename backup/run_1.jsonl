[{"prompt": "Sensitivity enhancement in planar microwave active-resonator using metal organic framework for CO2 detection\nThis work presents a proof of concepts of CO2 gas monitoring by a microwave sensor operating in microwave regime and study its sensitivity enhancement using an adsorbent bed of commercially available Zeolite 13X, and two synthesized MOF-199 (MOF-199-M1 and MOF-199-M2). The sensing principle of the sensor is based on the change in the dielectric properties of the bed, in response to CO2 concentration change in the dry CO2/He mixture. The sensor\u2019s response is quantified in terms of change in the resonant frequency with respect to baseline for each material. The sensor shows maximum sensitivity of 24kHz/% CO2 for MOF-199-M2 and minimum of 10kHz/% CO2 for Zeolite 13 X. The sensitivity of the microwave senor to CO2 concentration, with MOF-199-M2 as the bed is higher than MOF-199-M1, which can be related to the presence of different amount of unsaturated Cu2+ ions in their frameworks. XPS and XRD studies revealed marginal structure difference between MOF-199-M1 and MOF-199-M2. MOF-199-M2 has higher adsorption capacity compared to Zeolite 13 X and MOF-199-M1 at CO2 concentration 45 vol.% which demonstrates potential application of microwave sensors even at high CO2 concentration (45 vol.%) using MOF-199-M2. Further work needs to study the sensor\u2019s performance in non-dry gas streams at different levels of humidity and its integration with different materials to address the practical challenges, and to improve the selectivity of the sensor.\n\n###\n\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"CO2 gas monitoring\", \"sensor\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"sensor\", \"gas monitoring\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M1\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"sensor\", \"gas monitoring\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-199-M2\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"CO2\"], \"applications\": [\"CO2 detection\", \"sensor\", \"gas monitoring\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "Thermochemistry of paddle wheel MOFs: Cu-HKUST-1 and Zn-HKUST-1\nMetal-organic framework (MOF) porosity relies upon robust metal-organic bonds to retain structural rigidity upon solvent removal.

Imidazole molecules were frequently incorporated into porous materials to improve their proton conductivity. To investigate how different arrangements of imidazoles in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) affect the overall proton conduction, we designed and prepared a MOF-based model system. It includes an Fe-MOF as the blank, an imidazole@Fe-MOF (Im@Fe-MOF) with physically adsorbed imidazole, and an imidazole-Fe-MOF (Im-Fe-MOF), which contains chemically coordinated imidazole molecules. The parent Fe-MOF, synthesized from the exchange of carboxylates in the preformed [Fe3(\u03bc3-O)](carboxylate)6 clusters and multitopic carboxylate ligands, serves as a control. The Im@Fe-MOF was prepared by encapsulating free imidazole molecules into the pores of the Fe-MOF, whereas the Im-Fe-MOF was obtained in situ, in which imidazole ligands coordinate to the metal nodes of the framework. Proton-conductivity analyses revealed that the proton conductivity of Im-Fe-MOF was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than those of Fe-MOF and Im@Fe-MOF at room temperature. The high proton conductivity of 1.21 \u00d7 10-2 S cm-1 at 60 \u00b0C for Im-Fe-MOF ranks among the highest performing MOFs ever reported. The results of the density functional theory calculations suggest that coordinated imidazole molecules in Im-Fe-MOF provide a greater concentration of protons for proton transportation than do coordinated water molecules in Fe-MOF alone. Besides, Im-Fe-MOF exhibits steadier performance than Im@Fe-MOF does after being washed with water. Our investigation using the above ideal crystalline model system demonstrates that compared to disorderly arranged imidazole molecules in pores, the immobilized imidazole molecules by coordination bonds in the framework are more prone to form proton-conduction pathways and thus perform better and steadier in water-mediated proton conduction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole@Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im-Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"imidazole-Fe-MOF\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"[Fe3(\u03bc3-O)](carboxylate)6\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im@Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Im-Fe-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"proton conductivity\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks for highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\n\u00a9 2015 American Chemical Society. We report here the synthesis of a series of robust and porous bipyridyl- and phenanthryl-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO topology (BPV-MOF, mBPV-MOF, and mPT-MOF) and their postsynthetic metalation to afford highly active single-site solid catalysts. While BPV-MOF was constructed from only bipyridyl-functionalized dicarboxylate linker, both mBPV- and mPT-MOF were built with a mixture of bipyridyl- or phenanthryl-functionalized and unfunctionalized dicarboxylate linkers. The postsynthetic metalation of these MOFs with [Ir(COD)(OMe)]2 provided Ir-functionalized MOFs (BPV-MOF-Ir, mBPV-MOF-Ir, and mPT-MOF-Ir), which are highly active catalysts for tandem hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes followed by dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ethers as well as C-H borylation of arenes using B2pin2. Both mBPV-MOF-Ir and mPT-MOF-Ir catalysts displayed superior activities compared to BPV-MOF-Ir due to the presence of larger open channels in the mixed-linker MOFs. Impressively, mBPV-MOF-Ir exhibited high TONs of up to 17000 for C-H borylation reactions and was recycled more than 15 times. The mPT-MOF-Ir system is also active in catalyzing tandem dehydrosilylation/dehydrogenative cyclization of N-methylbenzyl amines to azasilolanes in the absence of a hydrogen acceptor. Importantly, MOF-Ir catalysts are significantly more active (up to 95 times) and stable than their homogeneous counterparts for all three reactions, strongly supporting the beneficial effects of active site isolation within MOFs. This work illustrates the ability to increase MOF open channel sizes by using the mixed linker approach and shows the enormous potential of developing highly active and robust single-site solid catalysts based on MOFs containing nitrogen-donor ligands for important organic transformations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"catalytic organic transformations\", \"tandem catalytic organic transformations via directed C-H activation\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations\", \"catalysts\", \"hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ethers\", \"C-H borylation of arenes\", \"B2pin2\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mBPV-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations\", \"catalysts\", \"hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ethers\", \"C-H borylation of arenes\", \"B2pin2\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"mPT-MOF\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations\", \"catalysts\", \"hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ethers\", \"C-H borylation of arenes\", \"B2pin2\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"BPV-MOF-Ir\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"Bipyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal-organic frameworks\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"highly efficient and tandem catalytic organic transformations\", \"catalysts\", \"hydrosilylation of aryl ketones and aldehydes\", \"dehydrogenative ortho-silylation of benzylicsilyl ether"}, {"prompt": "Solvent-controlled structural diversity observed in three Cu(II) MOFs with a 2,2\u2032-dinitro-biphenyl-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylate ligand: Synthesis, structures and magnetism\n\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

This porous material has been shown to facilitate the separation of mixtures of alkylaromatic compounds, including the BTEX mixture (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the regioisomers of xylene), into their pure components, in both the liquid and gas phases, in an energy-efficient manner which could have implications for the petrochemical industry.

CD-MOF retains saturated compounds to a greater extent than their unsaturated analogues. Also, the location of a double bond within a molecule influences its retention within the extended framework, as revealed in the case of the structural isomers of pinene and terpinine, where the isomers with exocyclic double bonds are more highly retained than those with endocyclic double bonds. The ability of CD-MOF to separate various mono- and disubstituted haloaromatic compounds appears to be controlled by both the size of the halogen substituents and the strength of the noncovalent bonding interactions between the analyte and the framework, an observation which has been confirmed by molecular simulations. Since CD-MOF is a homochiral framework, it is also able to resolve the enantiomers of chiral analytes, including those of limonene and 1-phenylethanol.

In addition to traditional semiconductor-based photocatalysts, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of micro\u2013mesoporous hybrid materials, are recently emerging as a new type of photocatalytic materials due to their unique structural characteristics. Among all the MOFs, Fe-containing MOFs are extremely appealing in photocatalysis since most of the Fe-based MOFs are visible light responsive due to the existence of extensive iron\u2013oxo (Fe\u2013O) clusters. In addition, Fe is an earth-abundant metal and Fe-containing complexes are commonly used in catalysis and photocatalysis. In this short review, we summarized the recent progress in using Fe-based MOFs for several photocatalytic applications, including pollutants degradation, water oxidation/reduction, CO2 reduction and organic transformations, with a focus on their different light-harvesting properties as compared with that of Ti- and Zr-containing MOFs as well as the structural influence on photocatalysis due to the existence of the diversified Fe-based MOFs.

Furthermore, spatially resolved emission quenching images obtained by confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that small (large) quencher molecules quickly (slowly) and homogeneously (inhomogeneously) penetrate microsized Eu-MOF crystals. These observations led us confidently to assume the possibility that Eu-MOFs work as a size-selective photocatalyst for the one-electron oxidation of organic compounds. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-5\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"determination of small molecule pollutants\", \"analysis of small molecule pollutants\", \"determination of macromolecules\", \"analysis of small molecule\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"MOF-235\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"determination of small molecule pollutants\", \"analysis of small molecule pollutants\", \"determination of macromolecules\", \"analysis of small molecule\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Cu-btc\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"determination of small molecule pollutants\", \"analysis of small molecule pollutants\", \"determination of macromolecules\", \"analysis of small molecule\"]}, {\"name_of_mof\": \"Uio-66(Zr)-2OH\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"determination of small molecule pollutants\", \"analysis of small molecule pollutants\", \"determination of macromolecules\", \"analysis of small molecule\"]}]\n\nEND\n\n", "gpt3_completion": " [{\"name_of_mof\": \"\", \"mof_formula\": \"\", \"mof_description\": [\"europium-based metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs)\"], \"guest_species\": [\"\"], \"applications\": [\"photocatalyst\", \"one-electron oxidation of organic compounds\"]}]"}, {"prompt": "Homogeneous decoration of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with core-shell structures on carbon nanotubes\n\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014. Considerable attention has focused on the combination of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) since both nanomaterials have outstanding properties. We describe a method for the homogeneous decoration of a MOF (ZIF-8 was chosen) onto the surfaces of CNTs dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidones (PVPs) in methanol, which was revealed by a scanning electron microscopic study. The homogeneous coating of the MOF on the CNTs, and nanostructures of the CNT-MOF were controlled by simply changing the concentrations of the MOFs. Furthermore, this method was also applicable to graphene and graphene oxide (GO).
